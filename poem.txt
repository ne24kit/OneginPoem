
Eugene Onegin
The Novel in Verse
By A.S. Pushkin

Verse Interpretation by Vladimir Balmont

Not for the high life entertaining,
Just being charmed by friendly care,
I’m giving you this bail intending
To reward you more just and fair
By worthy of your lofty feeling
Suffused with consecrated dream
The Poetry serene and living,
The thoughts and ease in high esteem.
But let it be, your care revealing
Accept the florid chapters’ row,
Semi-amusing, semi-wistful,
Ideal, folkish, sometimes blissful,
What my light-headed pen did draw,
The fruits of vigils, inspirations,
Immature and now faded years,
Of the cold mind’s observations
And of my heart so doleful breaths.

Chapter I

I

“My uncle used to be so sound,
But after falling gravely ill
Is craving homage, and has found
That could not make a better deal.
It is for others a good lesson,
But what a boredom is the session...
To watch a sick man day and night
And do not make a step aside!
What mean deceitfulness it is...
To feign compassion, dose the drugs,
To set and fluff the pillows, thus,
To entertain a half deceased,
To show fake sympathy, then, sigh
And think... Oh gosh, when will you die!”

II

It was what a young rake expected,
When dusting post-chaise speeded him,
By Zeus’s supreme will elected
The only heir of all his kin.
The friends of “Ruslan and Lyudmila”!
Here is my novel in verse hero,
With no preface and just right now
Let me acquaint you with the one...
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
Was born on Neva’s even shores,
Which, probably, were home of yours,
Or where you used to shine and revel.
It’s where I also used to play,
But North is not for me, they say.

III

His father served exactly fairly
Relying mostly on a debt,
At least three balls used to give yearly
And became bankrupt in the end.
Eugene’s fate, though, was well disposed...
At first, a Madame cared and nursed,
Then, paltry French cared for the kid.
The boy was frisky, but still sweet.
Monsieur l'Abbe was not too formal
Didn’t want to spoil the child’s rest,
Preferred to teach him just in jest
And didn't bore him with strict moral,
Reproved for pranks by gentle talk
To Summer Garden took for walk.

IV

And when the childhood was over,
There came the time for youthful play,
The time of hopes and tender sorrow,
Monsieur was fired right away.
No one restrained Onegin’s passion,
His hair was cut in modern fashion,
Like London dandy he was clothed
And finally had seen beau monde.
He demonstrated perfect bearing...
Could speak good French and wrote as well;
He danced Mazurka very well
And made a bow without straining.
What else you need? Beau monde could say
That he was very nice and sane.

V

Without diligence succeeding
In learning something and somehow
We, thanks to God, can flash with breeding,
It makes no difficulty now.
Onegin was by view of many
(Who judge severely, but fairly)
A scholar, but a prig, as well,
He had a talent, I can tell,
Without straining, simply chatting
To touch a subject quite a bit,
And just like knowing all of it
To remain silent when debating,
And to arose the ladies smile
By sudden epigrams’ brisk style.

VI

Latin today is not high value,
But if to be sincere and just,
He knew in Latin a good many...
The sense of epigraphs could grasp.
From Eneida in his mind
At least two verses he could find.
With Juvenal he was best friend,
Put vale in the letters end.
He didn’t have any inclination
To dig in prehistoric dust,
In detail analyze the past,
But funny stories of the ancient
From Romulo to recent day
He didn’t forget and did retain.

VII

He wasn’t at all a lofty person
To sacrifice his life for rhymes...
Iambus or trochee in the verses
Could never ever recognize.
He reproved greats of Ancient Greece,
By Adam Smith was really pleased,
In economics was expert,
Id est, could prove by means of what
The commonwealth can reach a progress,
How can a state exist and why
There is no need in gold supply,
When it avails a simple produce.
His dad could not that understand,
And put in pawn the estates’ land.

VIII

Discuss of all Onegin’s virtues
(No doubt) will take too much time,
But which of these had made a fortune,
What were his beliefs in the prime?
What was for him from infant’s years
The work, the suffer and the rest,
What occupied him all the day
Besides the melancholic stay?
It was the tender feels inciting
Hymned in the verses by Naso,
The art the poet suffered for,
By which his stormy time was shining;
From beloved Italy exiled
In the Moldova’s steppes he died.

IX X

How young was he to be dissembler,
Feel jealousy and harbor hope,
Persuade, dissuade, and then surrender
To feels, to look like sad or bored,
To appear proud and obedient,
Attentive, listless or convenient!
How was he languishing tightlipped,
And how expressively could speak!
How careless was in private letters!
And when something had stirred his blood
How could give up himself for love!
How fast and tender were his glances!
He could be bashful, could be gay,
And could drop tears, which were a play!

XI

How skillful was he to look modern,
To amaze innocence by jest,
To scare by recklessness a virgin,
By pleasing flattery impress,
To catch a minute of emotion,
To supersede by will and passion
The prejudice of naive years,
Expect unconscious sweet caress,
To pray and call for a confession,
To overhear the first soul’s sigh,
To follow love and in a while
To intercept a lady’s passion,
And later in a lonely site
To give her lessons in a quiet!

XII

How early he could make disquiet
A heart of regular coquette!
And when he wanted to wipe out
The rivals standing on his path,
How awfully caustic he was!
What artful nets he spread for those!
But you, the husbands, were so kind
That friendship with him did not mind...
He was caressed by cunning spouse -
Faublas’s old-established friend,
And a suspicious old man,
And cuckold, who looks always nice,
Is proud of his style of life,
His copious dinner and his wife.

XIII XIV XV

Sometimes, he used in bed still staying,
When they bring little notes; all right,
The invitations, they are saying
Three homes invite him for tonight...
Here is a ball, there is a party.
Where will proceed my naughty partner?
What place he’ll go to visit first?
He’ll manage all of it, of course.
And so far in a morning clothing,
In a wide hat la Bolivar
Onegin drives to boulevard,
And in the open air keeps strolling
Till sleepless Breguet rings him that
It is your lunchtime, don’t forget.

XVI

It’s getting dark, he went sleigh riding,
“Gee up” - the eager cabman cried;
With frosty silver dust was shining
The beaver collar in the night.
He dashed to chef Talon aware
Kaverin was awaiting there.
Gets in, - a cork with pop springs up,
And wine like comet jets to cup,
Here is a roast beef’s bloodstained slice,
And truffles - splendor for the youth,
French cuisine the highest proof,
And Strasburg pie so neatly lies
Between a slice of Limburg cheese
And a pineapple golden piece.

XVII

The thirst for goblets still requires
To quench the cutlets' fiery fat,
But Breguet watch’s bell reminds...
The theatre starts first ballet act.
The stage’s vicious fashion maker,
The charming actresses’ caretaker,
The well-known youthful theatre sage
And honored dweller of backstage,
Onegin speeded to the theatre,
Where everyone feels free and sage
To hiss an actor off the stage,
To catcall Ph(a)edra, Cleopatra,
To call Moina (to attract
Attention to himself by that).

XVIII

A magic land! There in old years
The freedom’s potentate Fonvisin
His satire plays with triumph staged,
And Knyazhnin made the public dizzy.
There, Ozerov shared presentations
Of people’s tears and clapping splashes
With young Semenova; just there
Appeared Katenin and did dare
Revive Corneille’s dramatic story,
And always biting Shakhovskoy
Became the comedies le roi;
That’s where Didlo was crowned with glory.
There, in the shadow of the wings
Flied by my youthful day’s extremes.

XIX

My goddesses! How are you doing?
Please, heed my voice and sad request...
Are you the same? Or other houris
Have occupied on stage your place?
Could I again hear your great chorus,
Could I see Russian Terpsichore’s
By soul performed exalted flight?
Or dismal glance will fail to find
On the dull stage the well-known faces,
And watching through lorgnette the world
I’ll be bystander sad and cold,
Indifferent to the new graces,
And yawning calmly and speechless
Will be remembering the past?

My goddesses! How are you doing?

XX

The hall is full, the boxes flashing,
The stalls and armchairs are in boil,
The circle top with clapping splashes,
A curtain rustles in a whirl.
Airy, magnificent and brilliant,
And to a fiddlestick obedient
Istomina stands in a crowd
Of nymphs, who make a nice background.
One of her feet touches the floor,
The other circles fairy light,
She suddenly jumps and is in flight,
Like fluff produced by Aeolus blow;
Now twists her waist, and now untwists,
By one quick foot the other beats.

XXI

All clapping. Here’s Onegin coming,
He goes through armchairs, steps on feet,
And his lorgnette aside aligning
Squints at the ladies in box seat;
The theatre tiers glancing over
He saw the faces and adornments,
Disliked these awfully, and then
Exchanged the bows with sitting men,
Glanced at the stage and all around,
And doing it with vacant look
Averted, yawned and did conclude...
“All those should be replaced, no doubt.
Ballets awake in me just bore,
Didlo doesn’t stir me anymore”.

XXII

The cupids, demons, snakes and devils
Still jump all over and make noise.
The tired lackeys at the doorways
Right on the fur coats are in drowse.
The footfall hasn’t, yet, pacified,
The cough and clapping have not quiet.
Inside and out of the theatre
The lamps are lighting by a glitter.
The horses thrashing in the cold
Are pretty tired of the harness.
The cabmen crowd at the fires,
Clap hands and idle masters scold.
Onegin now is getting off,
He forwards home to change the cloth.

XXIII

Can I depict my true impression,
A lonely private room portray,
Where foster child of the fashion
Was dressed, undressed and dressed again?
All stuff that busy London’s merchants
To agitate high life’s emotions
Bring to us through the Baltic waves
To change to wood, pigs’ fat and grains,
All what in Paris hungry taste
Invents for fun according fashion,
Promoting splendid life impression
To drive the trade, and that makes sense,
All that the study room adorned,
And to eighteen years sage belonged.

XXIV

Pipes’ amber from Constantinople,
Bronze on the table, chinaware,
Perfume in stylish cut-glass bottle
(A pleasure for effete young man),
Steel files for nails and combs for hair,
A set of scissors, curved and straight,
The brushes more than thirty breeds
To polish nails and brush the teeth.
Russo (to mention passing that)
Got really mad, when pompous Grim
Dared polish nails in front of him,
Romantic eloquent madcap.
The liberty and rights defender
This time was wrong that way to render.

XXV

You can be a pragmatic person,
Yet, care for beauty of your nails,
To cite against looks controversial,
Since people are the customs’ slaves.
Chadaev’s copy, my Onegin,
Being afraid of jealous blaming,
When choosing clothing was a prig
And followed fashions being strict.
Three hours he used at least
To spend in front of tailors’ mirrors,
And his from fitting room appearance
Reminded flighty Venus feast,
When she in menswear being clothed
To masquerade drives from abroad.

XXVI

I have attracted your attention
To his attires in last taste
And planned to show the modern fashion
By its description in details;
Of course, it would be pretty fearless,
To give descriptions is my business,
But pantaloons, frack and gilet,
I can’t collect in Russian, yet;
And I confess to you with shame
That my, besides all that, poor style
I am diluting time to time
With alien to my homeland names,
Though, in the past I used to glance
Over the lexicon not once.

XXVII

But now it’s not right thing to purpose,
We’d better gallop to a ball,
Where after changing of the clothes
Onegin speeded after all.
In front of faded buildings’ rows
Along the sleepy corridors
The double lamps of carriage lines
Pour out light and cheer the minds,
And rainbow on the snow induce.
The lampions shine all around,
A mansion glitters on a ground.
In windows shadows are produced
By moving heads of noble dames
And fancy looking odds and cranks.

XXVIII

Here is my hero at the entrance,
He passed a doorman in a rush,
Flied up the marble steps of staircase
And fixed his hair by fingers brush.
He gets into the crowded hall,
The music tiers to make roar,
Mazurka entertains the crowd
The noise and crush are all around.
The guardsmen's spurs are jingling lightly,
The flying feet of dancing dames
Leave in the air a charming trace,
The watching eyes are shining brightly.
And jealous whisper of the wives
Dies in the violins’ roars and cries.

XXIX

In days of revels and sensations
The balls to me made great delight,
It was right place for declarations,
For handing letters perfect site.
Oh, you, an honorable spouse!
I am appealing to your nous,
Please, listen to me and be wise,
I call you to oppose the vice.
And you, the mothers, be more strict
And to your daughters pay attention,
Keep your lorgnette at right direction,
Or, what can be? ... Oh, God forbid!
I write these lines one reason for,
Since I am not a sinner more.

XXX

In vain in diverse entertainments
I’ve killed a lot of my life way!
If it would not destroy the manners,
I’d love the balls till recent day.
I love this youthful animation,
And cram, and shine and exaltation,
And dames’ attire, smart and proud,
And ladies' legs, but am in doubt,
Since scarcely in the Russian lands
Three pairs of slender legs you’ll find.
Oh! How for long disturbed my mind
The image of this pair of legs.
And their seductive figuration
Till now disturbs imagination.

XXXI

Is there a wilderness or desert,
Where you, a madman, could forget
These pretty legs, and where at present
On vernal flowers they step?
Caressed in oriental comfort,
On northern doleful snowy carpet
They have not left the traces, yet,
Since loved to touch the carpets that
Were soft exciting lavish pleasure.
Because of them I skipped sometimes
The thirst for glory and for prize,
The land of fathers, freedoms’ treasure!
The happiness of youthful years
Has disappeared like their light trace.

XXXII

Diana’s breast and cheeks of Flora
Look pretty lovely, my good guys!
But Terpsichore’s cute leg, however,
Is much attractive in my eyes.
It presages to covert gaze
Inestimable sensual praise,
It does attract by pleasant form
The willful passions in a swarm.
Yes, I do love it, my Elvina,
When hidden under table cloth,
In spring, when stepping on greensward,
In winter time, when ballerina
Steps on the stage, on parquet floor,
And at a see shore on rock wall.

XXXIII

I saw the sea before storm coming...
What envy was aroused in me,
When after speedy heady running
The waves did drop at feet of thee!
With waves I was embraced by feeling,
To touch cute legs my lips were willing!
No, never in the blazing flames
Of my youth’s stormy boiling days
I ever wished it with such passion
To kiss Armides’ arousing lips,
Or flaming roses of the cheeks,
Or breast stirred up by love expression.
No, never ever passions’ whirl
Was so much rankling in my soul!

XXXIV

I cannot leave this in behind,
It’s where my cherished dream extends...
A happy stirrup in my mind...
I’m feeling female’s leg in hands!
Again the fantasy is boiling,
Again this touch of leg is burning,
It stirs up blood in withered heart,
Again this anguish and this love!
Though, it's enough to glorify
The arrogance of haughty creatures,
They are not worthy of these speeches,
I’d better still my chatty lyre.
These enchantresses’ words and glances
Are so deceptive... like feet’s traces!

XXXV

Where is Onegin? Half asleep,
From ball to bed he’s moved by carriage.
St. Petersburg does never sleep,
The drums are beating waking soldiers.
A merchant wakes, a pedlar walks,
A cab to stand is pulled by horse,
A dairymaid delivers milk,
Under her feet the snow makes squeak.
The morning noise refreshes air.
They open blinds; smoke by columns
Ascends upwards from burning ovens,
A baker - German, clean and fair,
In paper cap, exclaimed not once
His crackling language's was ist das.

XXXVI

But being worn by night time pleasure,
Has mixed up morning and midnight
The kid of luxury and leisure
Sleeps dreaming blissfully in quiet.
Gets up in p.m., and again
His life is scheduled for a day,
It is monotonous and bright,
And all the same, the day, the night...
But did it make my Eugene happy,
When he spent time in this delight
Triumphing victories and pride,
With no restraints, in bloom and healthy?
Or it is fruitless and in vain
To spend in revels night and day?

XXXVII

Too early he got rid of passions
And was annoyed with high life’s roar;
The beauties drew no more attention
And did not stir him anymore.
Unfaithfulness made him fatigued,
Of friends and friendship he got rid,
Since not for long he could and would
Eat beef-steaks and the Strasburg food
Spill with Champaign straight from a bottle,
And pour the spicy bitter words,
When at that time headache disturbs;
And though he loved the life to throttle,
He ceased to like it in the end -
The fight, the saber and the lead.

XXXVIII

A sickness of an unknown kind,
Which should be cleared long time ago
(It somehow English spleen reminds
And is khandra in Russian term),
Had seized him little at a time.
To shoot himself he did not try,
And thank you, God, for the assistance,
But he cooled off routine existence.
He showed himself in high society
Like Child Harold sullen, sad,
Nor boston, nor immodest chat,
Nor sigh or glance could now excite him,
No, nothing could awake his soul,
He was ignoring the whole world.

XXXIX XL XLI XLII

The female cranks of high society!
You were the first whom he ignored;
Since in that age (you can't deny it)
The high tone makes us pretty bored.
It happens, though, some noble ladies
Interpret Say and Bentham essays,
But on the whole, their naive chat
Is insupportable, I bet.
Besides, they are so chaste and pure,
So strict in judgment and exact,
Full of devotion and respect
That make me feeling sick and poor.
In front of them I feel so mean,
Just viewing those produces spleen.

XLIII

And you, young pretties (not the ladies),
Whom dashing cabs at time of night
Are speeding along cobbled roadways,
Onegin them as well declined,
Had left without hesitations,
Relinquished stormy delectations,
Decided to stay home alone;
Then took a pen and stifling yawn
He wished to write, but patient labor
Arose in him aversion, so
His pen had grasped nothing at all,
And guild of writers was disfavored.
I cannot judge of those because
I by myself belong to those.

XLIV

And then, anew, as always idle
And being by a void depressed
He tried this time the others' mind
To privatize. Here, I say - Yes!
Thus, on a shelf he’d set books row
And tried to read them, but what for?
Here’s boredom, there is fraud or lie,
Here - lack of conscious, there - poor style,
And all of them are far from freemen.
The old ones look quite obsolete,
The new - the old ones repeat.
Thus, he’d left books like did with women,
The shelf, where books were set in row,
He covered with taffeta cloth.

XLV

When I’d got rid of public burden
And like Onegin left world’s vain,
I’d become to him a good fellow,
Because his features pleased my brain...
To dreams spontaneous devotion,
The oddity, which was unconscious,
And sharp and ice cold style of mind.
I was aggressive, he was quiet.
We both had learned the passions plays...
We both of life were pretty tired,
In both the flame in heart had died,
Both were expecting in young days
To be exposed to blind Fortune’s
And envy people’s evil tortures.

XLVI

He, who did live and used to reason,
Cannot avoid despise to men,
He, who did feel, he is imprisoned
By phantoms of the vanished day...
He is away from fascinations.
This one is gnawed by recollections,
That - by repentance occupied,
And that is why we often find
A special charm in conversations.
At first, Onegin’s language was
Annoying to me, then, did cause
Respect to his exaggerations,
Jokes impregnated with the bile
And biting epigrams’ harsh style.

XLVII

How often in a summer season,
When above Neva, the white night
Appeared like light majestic vision,
And river’s surface gay and bright
Did not display the moon reflection,
In former passions recollection,
In recollection love affairs
We were forgetting all the cares,
And by the well-disposed night’s breathing
We were so speechlessly bewitched!
Like sleepy convict being switched
From calaboose to forest greening,
That’s how in dream we streamed away
To the beginning of young day.

XLVIII

With soul embraced by sorrow feeling
And leaning on a granite shelf
Onegin stood immersed in dreaming
As Poet had portrayed himself.
Allover silence, in the distance
The sentries’ calls recalled existence;
The sounds of a cab wheel rumble
Disturbed the calm all of a sudden.
A boat was gliding dozing river
In silence flapping with the oars;
A shepherd horn broke in the drowse,
And dashing song of remote singer...
But by Torquato octave rhymes
Grant to me even more surprise!

XLIX

Oh, Brenta, Adriatic spaces,
I wish to cast at you my glance!
And hearing your majestic splashes
Will animate my soul at once!
For the Apollo’s lyre successors,
Due to the British poets lessons,
You are familiar, my own.
In golden Italy, I know,
At liberty I’ll play and revel,
With young Venetian spend time.
She’ll chat and hush then for a while.
In mystic gondola we’ll travel.
And thanks to that I shall acquire
The love’s and Petrarch’s tongue and lyre.

L

Would ever I hear freedom chiming?
It’s time, it’s time! - I want be free!
I stroll by sea shore weather minding
And beckon boats' sails in the sea.
When shall I leave this boring order?
Clothed by the storms with waves I’ll quarrel,
And run to unrestricted span.
It’s time to leave the boring land,
The elements to me unpleasing,
And in the midday’s wavy space -
In Africa, my old folk’s place,
To sigh of gloomy Russian being,
Of where I suffered, where I loved,
And where my heart I’ve given up.

LI

Onegin was prepared with me
To see the world and change the place,
But we were trapped by destiny
That separated us for years.
His father passed away, and shortly
A regiment of lenders brought him
A lot of papers, which required
How to escape from debts to find.
Onegin hated litigation
And, by his fortune satisfied,
Let them the heirloom to divide
And did it with no hesitation,
Since got the news from far away...
His uncle planned to pass away.

LII

He’d really got all of a sudden
The estate manager’s report...
His uncle wants to say last pardon,
He’ll shortly leave the naughty world.
Had read this sad and grievous letter
Onegin didn’t postpone the matter
And started dashing headlong race
Beforehand yawning in post-chase,
And, as I told in the beginning,
To suffer for the money sake
The sighs, and tedium, and fake.
But when he’d reached the one who’s leaving,
He’d seized him on a table worth
To be a tribute to the earth.

LIII

The stead was full of the complaisance;
Who liked the deceased and disliked
To demonstrate their great compassions
Came visit the burial site.
The uncle’s funeral was set,
The priests and neighbors drank and ate,
And after left with solemn words,
Like being busy afterwards.
Eugene is now the only owner
Of many peasants, forests, lands,
Of rivers, factories and plants,
He, who was order’s foe and squander,
But he is glad that former stay
He’s changed to something, anyway.

LIV

Two days he found it quite novel...
To watch remoteness of the fields,
In dusk of oakery to follow
The serene brook’s murmuring spills.
But on the third day of the staying
All that didn’t look so entertaining;
Then, all this bliss made him asleep,
And he had found quite distinct...
The country is same boredom, though,
Without palaces and streets,
Without cards, balls, verses’ rhythms.
Khandra affects him overall,
And it will chase him all his life,
Like shadow or a faithful wife.

LV

I was conceived for peaceful being,
For country’s fascinating calm,
The more in thickets, better hearing
Of lyre’s creative tongue and charm.
I stroll by a deserted lake
By naive pastime entertained,
And far niente is my law.
Each morning I am waking for
The honey bliss and freedom’s moments...
I read not much and sleep for long
And like I did in days of old
Don’t hunt for glory’s fake adornments.
My best and happiest young days
I spent in idleness in shades.

LVI

The country, flowers, field spaces,
Love, idleness - I adore those!
I’m glad to note the variations,
Which differ my and Eugene’s souls.
I do not want a mocking reader
Or other literature figure
Composing intricate blackwash
Collate Onegin with me, gosh,
Forgetting shame claim it wherever
That a self-portrait I did write,
Like Byron, poet of the pride,
And am not able, never ever,
To write the poems more or less,
But of myself and nothing else.

LVII

And by the way, the poet’s mind
Reveres the dreamy love, that’s why
The lovely things, I used to find,
Appeared to me in dreams, and I
These covert images retained,
And let my Muse to animate...
Thus, highland virgin I did praise,
Who drew me to a great amaze,
And captives of the Salgir river...
And nowadays from you, my dear,
A frequent question I do hear...
“Who now arouses your lyre’s fever?
To whom of all these jealous lasses
You dedicated your lyre’s graces?

LVIII

Whose gaze, exiting inspiration,
By sweet caress had made a prize
For your poetic meditation?
Whom did your verses idolize?”
No, friends, by Heaven, no one, yet!
And all my reckless love attempts
Were all in vain with no delight.
These poets blissful, who combined
Both, love and rhythms and by that doubled
The sacred poetry delire
Recalling the great Petrarch’s lyre,
And by the heartache not more troubled
Caught fame and glory by God’s will.
But I in love was dumb and still.

LIX

My Muse had come, when love expired,
She broke the obscured mind’s bonds.
I’m free again, want to combine
My thoughts, and feels, and magic tones.
I write and please by that my heart,
My pen is firm and behaves smart,
At the unfinished rhymes does not
Draw female's legs, heads and so forth;
Extinguished ash will not make fire,
I'm still nostalgic, but no tears,
And very soon the stormy feels
Will disappear, leave me in quiet.
I’ll start a poem, then, I guess
Of twenty songs at least, not less.

LX

I built the plot of my new novel
And thought, what would be its content;
And now a page you’re turning over,
Where is first chapter’s very end.
I have examined written strictly...
There are mistakes, if to check neatly;
I won’t amend these or correct.
To censor I will pay my debt,
And, then, present it for reviewing
To journalists - the public wolves.
I beg, my newborn creature, move
To Neva’s banks for public viewing!
Please, earn the tributes of the glory...
The idle talks, clamor and quarrel!


Chapter II

I

The country, where Eugene was boring,
Was a scenic and charming place;
The one, who’s innocence enjoying,
This nook would evidently bless.
The landlord solitary dwelling
Above a creek was quietly laying
Under the lee of a small hill,
In front of it a lovely scene...
The golden fields and blooming meadows,
The villages dropped here and there,
The flocking herds and country air;
An uncared park by the thick shadows
Extended far away its spreads -
A pensive shelter for Dryads.

II

A worthy mansion was erected
As for the castles it should be...
Perfectly durable and tranquil,
In style as smart antiquity.
The lofty chambers all around,
Damask wallpaper in the parlor,
The royal portraits on the walls,
The parti-colored tiles on stoves.
All that has now dilapidated,
And I don’t really know why,
So far as for the friend of mine,
He wasn’t at all by that affected,
Since he was yawning when he strolled
Both, modern room and ancient hall.

III


He’d settled in the mansion’s chamber,
Where the old timer for great whiles
With housekeeper used to ramble,
Sat at a window and crushed flies.
Everything casual... the oak floors,
The table, sofa, two cupboards,
And not a speck of ink, do note.
Onegin opened one cupboard -
Obtained the housekeeper’s papers,
The other one - the bottles line,
A row of jugs with apple wine,
Eighteen eighth calendar, the latest.
The old was busy at all times
And other books didn’t recognize.

IV

Onegin bored, and then decided,
Just idle time to pass away,
To change routine and thus provided
A reformation in estate.
And in his nook the sage of desert
The corvee - ancient yoke of peasant
By easy quitrent had replaced,
And serf had blessed the divine grace.
But thrifty neighbor was in pouts,
Suspecting in it a great harm
To his hereditary farm,
Another archly smiled in doubts,
And all of them made a conclusion
That he is awfully unusual.

V

At first all neighbors gave him visits,
But since he used at the back porch
To keep a steed and quickly use it
Just hearing an approaching coach,
It did not make the neighbors glad,
Some of them really got mad,
And they all stopped attempts to deal
And even keep in touch with him.
“He’s ignoramus, behaves wildly;
He is freemason, that is why
Drinks from a tumbler just red wine;
Doesn’t kiss dames’ hands, doesn’t bow politely,
Dose not say yes, ma’am, or no, sir,
But always simply yes or no”.

VI

It’d happened that another landlord
At the same time nearby arrived
And to the same conformist neighbor
A cause for gossip did provide.
Vladimir Lensky was his name,
With soul like born in Gottingen,
A handsome in the prime of life,
A poet, and with Kant in love.
In misty Germany he’d borrowed
The elevated expertise...
The freedom-loving reveries,
An ardent spirit (quite uncommon),
Rhapsodic manor of the talk,
And the black curls to shoulders long.

VII

He was too young to be depraved
By high society’s dissipation,
His soul was warmed up by the care
Of friends and maidens’ adoration.
At heart an ignorant naive,
He cherished hope and was deceived
By the new world’s uproar and shine
That still imprisoned his young mind.
He entertained his soul by dreaming
To pacify the mind’s doubt,
And could not stop to think about
The purpose of the human being.
That was the thing that racked his brains,
And he perceived the magic tales.

VIII

And he believed, there is a soul,
Which’s of a similar communion,
And languishing it’s searching for
The one with whom would make a union,
That friends would prefer shackles bearing
Than let someone his name defaming,
And none of them would ever waver
To smash a vessel of a slander;
That there are chosen by the fortune
The people’s sacramental friends,
Someday they’ll get the magic brands
And save humanity from tortures;
The world will stay in pleasant tranquil,
And people will be for that thankful.

IX

Regret, deep sorrow, indignation
And for the glory honey craving
Alike stirred his blood agitation,
Since young enkindled his soul flaming.
He wandered in the world with lyre
Under the Schiller-Goethe’s sky;
And their creative Muses’ blaze
Had brought his soul into amaze.
The elevated Muses’ lyrics
He, being lucky man, maintained,
And in his songs with pride retained
The always lofty noble feelings,
The impulses of virgin dream
And charming ease in high esteem.

X

He song the love to love devoted,
His lyric tongue was pure and bright,
Like dreams a virgin openhearted,
Like sleeps a newborn, like at night
The Luna in the sky is shining,
Goddess of mystery and sighing.
He song sad parting and deplored
An obscured something in remote.
Romantic roses glorifying
He song the countries far away,
Where being in a dream one day
He shed the alive tears in quiet;
He song the withered being cold
And was not, yet, eighteen years old.

XI

In wilderness, where Eugene only
Could value his romantic gifts,
He didn’t like visit local landlords,
Who entertained themselves by feasts.
And he kept off their noisy sessions
And the judicious conversations
About haying, taste of wine,
About dogs and kin of mine.
They didn’t excel neither by feeling,
Nor by poetic charming flame,
Neither by wittiness of brain,
Nor by the art of common living.
But conversations of their wives
Were even worse and much less wise.

XII

Vladimir being rich and handsome
Was cared as bridegroom candidate,
It is a countrymen’s convention...
Search for a daughter a good mate.
He just comes in and is attacked
By the suggestions hinted at
The boredom of unmarried life
And pleasantness of a nice wife.
They call him to a samovar,
Where Dunya pours a cup of tea,
They whisper... “Dunya, do you see!"
And after bring her a guitar...
And she begins to squeak (my God!)
Come to my chamber made of gold!

XIII

But Lensky not at all desired
To bear the heavy wedlock chains,
And was sincerely inspired
With my Onegin to make friends.
What distance is from ice to flame,
From prose to verse, from rock to wave?
Nothing could differ more than those!
They got in contact and at first
Both bored when gathering together,
Then liked each other; shortly they
Met riding horseback every day,
Stroke up close friendship just forever.
Thus, people (yes, I do repent)
Of doing nothing get a friend.

XIV

But what is friendship? We consider
(Denying prejudice as fake)
The friends as just an added zero,
I am a figure of high rank.
I’ll be Napoleon, no kidding;
And any other human being,
Is just an implement, and thus,
A feel is absurd thing for us.
Onegin had more just perception;
Yes, he had learned the people well,
In general despised all them,
But (are there rules with no exception?)
To some of these he showed respect,
And feels of those did not neglect.

XV

Thus, Lensky’s speech evoked his smile.
The poet’s flaming conversation,
Inspired gaze and mind’s style,
Yet, not too firm in estimations,
All that looked to Eugene quite new;
And to make calming down review
He did not hurry, since he thought
That it is not too smart to stop
This minute-long gushing existence.
Let him, so far, in that believe
And with that faith in life still live;
It’ll stop without my assistance.
Forgive to fever of young years
Delirium and passion flares.

XVI

All matters caused argumentations,
Invited them to clarify...
What were the tribes negotiations,
The fruits of learning, truth and lie?
The superstitions centuries old,
The coffin mysteries dead cold,
The fate and life were analyzed,
Severely judged and criticized.
The poet in a flame of judgment
Read in oblivion time to time
The extracts from a northern rhyme,
Onegin, patient and indulgent,
Though could not catch it in detail,
Tried to perceive the youngster's tale..

XVII

More often, minds of my hermits
Were by the passions entertained;
Having escaped from stormy torments
Onegin usually conveyed
These talks with sighs of consolation.
Blessed is who witted exaltation,
But then resigned with no regret,
More blessed, who never new all that,
Who chilled his love by a departure,
The grudge- by gossip, and sometimes
With friends and wife could not hold sighs,
Who never suffered jealous torture,
Who did not play and never tried
His grandpa’s wealth to deuce confide.

XVIII

When we shall resort at a banner
Of wise and reasonable calm,
When passions and excitement fever
Will die, and we shall see just fun
In bursts of willfulness and passions,
Belated judgements and reactions, -
Not free of efforts and submissive
We, sometimes, would prefer to listen
To others’ rebel passions whirling.
It stirs emotions in the heart,
Like staying always in his hut
An olden crippled man is turning
Attention to the young men’s tales
Being forsaken for long days.

XIX

But ardent youngsters, it’s no doubt,
Are never ready to conceal
And always eager to let out
Their love, or grief, or other feel.
A loser in the love affairs,
Onegin heard with a stern face
Sincere cordial confession,
The ardent poet’s self-expression;
Vladimir, when in exaltation,
His soul did artlessly display,
Onegin shortly was aware
Of all his feels and adoration -
The story rich in sentiments
With quite familiar contents.

XX

Ah, he did love like nowadays
Nobody by love can be blessed,
Since only poet’s soul still prays
To love and feels its real taste.
Wherever, always the same dreaming,
One and the same familiar feeling,
One and the same and well known sorrow,
No promise to relax tomorrow.
Neither long years of separation,
Nor fell into poetic trance,
Nor beauties of a far off place,
Nor learning fruits, nor inspiration
Could change his soul, the same desire
Was heating it by virgin fire.

XXI

To Olga since the adolescence,
When he hadn’t learned love tortures, yet,
He used to be a witness pleasant
Of her young plays, and moved by that
In leafy forest’s saving shades
He shared with her the youthful plays.
For neighbors, friends and both their dads
They were for marriage candidates.
Being naively nice like fairy,
In wilderness, in charming calm,
And by the view of dad and mum
She bloomed like lily of the valley,
Which was not touched in grass’s wilds
Neither by bees nor butterflies.

XXII

She was that one who had inspired
The poet’s raptures first delight,
And animated in his mind
The virgin moan of dreaming pipe.
Farewell to you, the golden plays!
He fell in love with forests’ shades,
Seclusion, loneliness and quiet,
The Stars, and Moon, and Magic Night.
The Moon - night sky illumination,
Which called us to the night time strolls
In dark among the forest’s walls,
Provoked the tears, brought consolation...
But now, when looking at its face,
We think, you’re nice, since lamp replace.

XXIII

She’s always modest and obedient,
And cheery like a morning rise,
With open heart, like poet’s being,
Like kiss of love is sweet and nice.
Her eyes are shining blue like sky;
The flaxen curls and tender smile,
Light movements, lovely voice and waist,
All these adornments Olga has.
But any novel take and read,
And I am sure you will find
A heroine who will remind
Olga’s sweet image; it’s, indeed
Makes me annoyed, and not to pester
I’m switching to the elder sister.

XXIV

Tatiana was her sister’s name...
For tender verses it’s uncommon,
But I shall bring to it new fame
And sanctify by tender novel.
It’s sonorous and nice, no doubt,
When hearing it I think about
The mysteries of olden years
And maidens’ room; yet, I confess,
The native morals are corrupted
Affecting Russian names, as well
(And rhymes, so far as I can tell);
From education we’ve adopted,
Just airs and graces, nothing else,
The real learning they replace.

XXV

Thus, elder sister’s name Tatiana.
The same amaze she could not rise
As did the pretty charming minor,
Could not by same attraction prize.
She’s given to reflection, shy,
Like fallow deer when followed by,
And in the parents’ native home
Looked like not being of their own.
To show caress she hardly could
Neither to mother, nor to father,
Being a kid in children’s crowd
To jump and play she scarcely would.
And used in solitude to stay,
At window sitting all the day.

XXVI

Pensiveness was her best girlfriend
From very days of lullaby,
By dreams she used to decorate
The country’s idleness calm fly.
The mollycoddled fingers even
Didn’t ever touch a sewing needle,
She never knew how to make lace,
To pattern cloth with silky trace.
A thirst for ruling over omen...
With an obedient doll the girl
In jest prepares to play her role
In the high life, how to be formal,
And after mother repeats
The lessons of the public treats.

XXVII

But even in the adolescence
Tatiana didn’t take dolls on hands
And never used to give them lessons
Or tell the news or fashion trends.
And in the childish pranks and plays
She wasn’t involved, but loved the tales,
Which made excited and were fearful,
When being told at night in winter.
And when the nanny used to gather
The Olga’s little friends to play,
The race-and-catch or other game
On a capacious sunny meadow,
She didn’t enjoy the loud noise,
The ringing laugh and careless joys.

XXVIII

She loved to greet the coming dawning,
Forestall on balcony the day,
When in the pale sky night stars glowing
Diminishes and goes away,
Lightens the border of the Earth,
And wind, the morning sunrise worth,
Like herald blows - the day comes in.
In winter, when the days are thin,
A shade of night is calmly slipping,
And in the silent idle quiet
Under a faded dim moonlight
The lazy East for long is sleeping,
She woke up at a usual time
In the twilight of candles’ shine.

XXIX

She liked the novels since her young,
They opened universe to her,
And she preferred illusions’ tongue
Of Richardson and J. Russo.
Her dad was always nice and straight,
In the past century delayed;
Beware of books he had no ground
And never reading them had found
That they were just a hollow toy.
He absolutely did not mind,
What was that secret volume kind,
Which his shy daughter did enjoy.
So far as for his pleasant wife,
She was with Richardson in love.

XXX

Yes, she was fond of Richardson
Not thanks to his great novels reading
And, thus, preferring Grandison
To Lovelace hiding secret feeling.
Her Moscow cousin, young princess
Alina, who had read it, yes,
Told her of that, and just because
Her future spouse at that time was
Her suitor, whom she didn’t adore,
And she was sighing for a guy,
Who was more clever and less shy,
Whom she preferred and adored more.
This Grandison was brave and smart,
A gambler and a sergeant guard.

XXXI

Like him she used to be attired
In modern fashion, looking fine;
Though, wedding was against desire,
It was by parents sanctified.
To dissipate his spouse’s mourn
The clever husband very soon
Left to the country, where she found
Herself in Lord knows what surround.
She rent her hair and wept, at first,
But then, by household distracted,
And being by the life affected
She with her husband didn’t divorce.
We all get habit from above,
And it replaces good and love.

XXXII

The habit pacified her sorrow,
Which by no means could be repulsed,
She’d learned a hold to get it over
That resurrected her at last...
So switching business time and leisure
She had unveiled a secret measure
How to hold over like a reign
Her husband, thus to put away
Her mourn. She started to keep records,
Inspected field works on weekdays,
Enjoyed the baths on Saturdays,
Used to brine mushrooms and shave recruits,
She beat her maids for the omissions
And never asked for spouse permissions.

XXXIII

It happened that instead of ink
She by her blood the albums signed,
She named Praskov’ya Paulin,
And spoke singsong and deeply sighed;
She wore the corsets fitted tight
And Russian N in French did write;
When saying words, she nasalized;
But soon all that was finalized;
The corset, Album and Alina,
A copybook with touching rhymes
She had forsaken in past times,
Backed to Akul’ka from Selina
And finally decided that
It’s time to change the robe and hat.

XXXIV

The husband loved the sweetheart deeply,
Didn’t pay attention to her deals,
And trusting to the wife completely
In an old robe appeared to meals.
His life in calm and peace was streaming...
Sometimes, before the coming evening
Informal family of guests
In manor-house congregates
To mourn, to laugh, to title tattle
About passed and current life,
And when in parlor clock chimes five,
To order Olga tea, and later
A supper follows, say good night,
The guest are leaving satisfied.

XXXV

And they retained in calm and peace
The customs of the ancient time,
And during Russian Shrovetide feast
The oily pancakes used to fry.
Twice yearly fast they used to keep,
The round swings they liked to swing,
Loved to hear singing during lunch
And Whitsun round dances much,
And yawning listened to a prayer;
Compassioned, on a bunch of herb
Three tears by each they used to drop,
And kvass like air was necessary,
And at the table to the guests
The dish(e)s were served complied with ranks.

XXXVI

And that’s how they were growing old.
The husband first reached fatal limit,
Stepped over the Beyond threshold
And left the other world to visit.
He died before the time for lunch,
Was by the neighbors bemoaned much,
By children and his faithful wife,
Who shared with him the happy life.
He was a straight and kind lord,
And at a place his ash was laid
A mournful monument proclaimed...
Here Dmitry Larin - slave of God,
A brigadier and fair landlord,
Enjoys in peace the Great Beyond.

XXXVII

After return to hearth and home,
Vladimir Lensky came to visit
His neighbor’s sorrowful gravestone,
And heaved a sigh, when he did see it.
And for a long time he was sad.
“Poor Yorick - dolefully he said, -
He hold me on his hands sometimes,
I used to play with his war prize -
A medal he got from Suvorov!
Intended Olga he for me,
And used to say... when would it be?”
And stirred by a sincere sorrow
Vladimir started to inscribe
A madrigal at the graveside.

XXXVIII

And at the same place memorized
His parents by the filial tears
And weepy verses had inscribed
Being embraced by fatal fears.
The generations make a round,
Sprout out, mature and fade down
Controlled by Providence’s will;
Their issue follows same routine...
Thus, we, today in bloom and silly,
Grow up, enjoy, boil up and swing,
The ancestors to coffins bring.
But time for us will come, yes, really,
And the grandsons will oust us
And say politely “Bye, grandpas!”

XXXIX

So far, do revel your existence
And easy life, my novel’s friend!
I recognize its worthless essence
And am not scared to see the end;
My eyelids for illusions dropped,
But sometimes distant signs of hope
Disturb my heart... I realize
That it’ll be sad not recognized
To leave this world without traces.
I live and write not for a praise,
But, probably, want to amaze
The world and reveal real graces.
I hope the rhymes I’ve left behind
Will of the poet’s life remind.

XL

And they will touch somebody’s heart,
And being cared by lucky fate
The strophes and rhymes, which now I write,
Will not be lost in later date;
And I believe (myself I flatter!)
The issue will retain my letter,
Seeing my portrait, reading name
“He was the Poet!” they will say.
Thus, please, accept my real thanks
A fan of peaceful Aonides,
I greet the one who’ll recognize
My flying poetry’s attempts,
Whose thankful favorable hand
Will pet the laurels of old man!


Chapter III

I

"Where do you go? These crazy poets!”
- Goodbye, Onegin, time to leave.
“I don't hold you, but, to the point,
Where do you plan to spend the eve?”
- At Larins. - “That looks pretty nice.
And do you not at all despise
In such a boredom kill your time?”
- Not in the least. - “But it’s what I
From here can see and may suggest...
First, listen to me, am I right?
It is a kin of Russian rite,
Who loves to overwhelm the guests
With all these jams and nonstop talks
Of rain, of yard, of flax, of wax...”

II

- I do not see here any trouble.
“But boredom troubles me, my friend!”
- I hate your high society’s manner
And love the country’s modest trend,
When I can... - “Here, again eclogue!
Enough, my friend, for sake of God.
All right, you’re leaving, what a pity.
Though, listen, Lensky, you can treat it,
Can you let me see your Phyllida,
Who inspirers your poetic tone,
The tears, the verses and so on?
Present me to her”. - Are you kidding?
“Not, yet. And when?” - Let’s do it now.
They will be glad to meet us. - “Wow!

III

Let’s go.” - The friends jumped on the horses,
And when appeared were met by hosts
With all these tiresome resources,
As was established by the olds.
They welcomed guests and tried to feed
With all these jams and treats, indeed,
A waxen jug was placed on table -
Cowberry water for the neighbor,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

IV


They’re riding back the shortest way
And speed full tilt to make it quick,
Let’s overhear what do they say
To be aware of what they think.
- Well, well, Onegin, you are yawning. -
- “A habit, Lensky”. - You are boring
More than you used to do before. -
“No, it’s the same. It’s darkened, though.”
He shook the rein - “Gee up, Andryushka!
How dull and boring is the way!
And as for Larina, I’d say,
She’s simple but a nice babushka.
Cowberry water troubles me,
It disturbs stomach. Oh, my dear...

V

Can you tell me, who’s there Tatiana?”
- She is the one who’s looking sad,
Who was same silent as Svetlana,
Came in and at the window sat. -
“Do you adore the junior, really?
- And what? - “Not she would stir my feeling,
When I was a poetic guy.
There is no life in Olga’s style.
She’s like Madonna by Van-Dyke,
Who’s always perfect, utters bliss,
Like this fool moon in calm and peace
Illumes this also foolish sky”.
Vladimir answered with a frown
And all the way was mute and stern.

VI

Meanwhile, Onegin’s evening mission
To widow Larina’s estate
Had left a serious impression
And all the neighbors entertained.
The guesses shifted and they found
Not sinless but a playful ground
To show good judgment and to say
That he’s Tatiana’s fiance.
Some of them even clarified
That marriage settlement was made,
But then delayed because they failed
The modern wedding rings to find.
And that Vladimir plans to marry
All of them knew for long already.

VII

Tatiana heard with some vexation
This tittle-tattle nonsense, though,
She felt unreasoned hesitation,
The dim emotions stirred her soul.
And something sparkled in her heart;
The time had come, she fell in love.
Thus, grain in spring when falls on soil,
Sprouts out in a sunlight boil.
For long her flamed imagination
Stirred by a bliss and by a grief
Craved for a fatal heart relief;
For long a secret expectation
Did stir the youthful breast by flame,
She was awaiting... and he came.

VIII

Yes, he has come ... It’s cleared the sight;
And she pronounced... that is him!
And now the day and sleepless night
And burning solitary dream
All full of him; nonstop and endless
A magic force arose remembrance,
All speaks of him. She is annoyed
By pleasant words the people told
And glances of the maids around.
In gloomy thoughts her mind rests,
She does not listen to the guests
And curses all that her surrounds,
By neighbors visits she’s not pleased,
And execrates long stay of these.

IX

And what a serious attention
Attracts a novel, which she reads,
And what a lively inspiration
This fake delusion brings and heats!
She animated in her dreams
The heroes and the heroines...
A beau of Julia Volmar,
Malek-Adel and de Linar,
And Werther by the passions chained,
And super peerless Grandison,
Who causes nothing but a yawn, -
All of them in the dreamer’s brain
In single image were combined
And Eugene only did remind.

X

She dreams she is a heroine
By the creators, whom believes, -
Clarissa, Julia, Dauphin,
And strolling in the forests’ peace
Tatiana reads the books and finds
The things, which stir her inflamed mind,
The secret passions of her dreams,
The fruits of cordial extremes.
She sighs and to herself assigning
The others’ sorrow and delight
She in oblivion tells by heart
A note to one whom is admiring.
Whoever was my hero, yet,
He was not Grandison, I bet.

XI

An ardent thrilling novel author
His style to pompous fashion tunes
And a superior hero offers
To conquer us and to amuse,
Depicts a hero, whom he loves
(Who badly treated was not once),
A sensitive and tender fellow
With handsome face and who is clever,
Who’s ready to be killed for friend
Being inflamed by purest passion.
He always leaves the best impression,
And in last chapter’s very end
The vice is punished, after that
The virtue gets the triumph wreath.

XII

But nowadays the minds are foggy,
Morality inspires a yawn,
The vice is welcomed, in the stories
The virtue is not gloried more.
The British Muse’s fairytales
Disturb the maidens’ sleeps and plays,
And now the objects for desire
Are either despondent Vampire
Or Melmoth by the phantoms tortured,
Eternal Jew or brave Corsair
Or so mysterious Sbogar.
Lord Byron thanks to lucky fortune
Drowned us in fade romanticism
And always hopeless egoism.

XIII

Oh, my dear friends, is all in vain?
And, maybe, sometimes willed by heaven,
Poetic dreams will leave my brain,
I’ll be engaged by other demon,
And despite radiant Phoebus threat
I’ll to submissive prose descend;
In old traditions routine novel
Will occupy me being old man.
Not secret evil fatal tortures
I shall depict in passion’s storm,
I shall rehearse you being stern
The tales of Russian nobles’ fortunes,
The charming dreams of adoration,
The mores and manners of the ancient.

XIV

I shall retell the casual speeches
Of dad and uncle, old and frail,
The children’s hold in secret meetings
At the old lime trees and a well,
The dismal jealousy wild torments,
Departs, reconciliation moments;
I’ll force them quarrel, after that
Shall put on them a wedding wreath...
I’ll recall speech of tender passion,
The words of melancholic love,
Which in the days I told above
At beauty’s legs in the affection
Used to occur in my flamed mind
And which today I’ve left behind.

XV

Tatiana, charming girl Tatiana!
With you I drop my tears today,
To awful hands of fancy tyrant
You’ve given up your life and fame.
You’ll perish, darling, but before
For vague and obscure bliss you call
And dazzled by an expectation
You learn the pangs of adoration,
You drink desire’s magic venom,
You’re followed by an unreal dream
And do imagine one same thing -
For happy dates a lovely venue;
And everywhere in front of you
There is your tempter’s fatal view.

XVI

Anguish of love drives Tanya out,
She escapes to the park to mourn,
Then, sudd(e)nly stops, can’t look around,
Is paralyzed by lazy mood.
Her breast high raised, the heart beats fast,
The breath has stopped to leave the chest,
The cheeks start instantly to blaze,
Noise in the ears, the burning gaze ...
The night falls down, and the moon
Patrols the remote heavens’ dome;
A nightingale starts singing song
In the dark shades of leafy room.
Tatiana in the dark doesn’t sleep,
And in hush tone to nanny speaks...

XVII

“I can’t sleep... stifling... nanny, darling!
Open the window, sit with me”.
- What’s with you, Tanya? - “I am boring,
Let’s talk of old times and of thee”.
- What can I tell you, Tanya? Sometimes
I used to know the tales of old times,
Both, very true and purely fibs,
About maidens, evil beasts;
But now all drawn in darkness, Tanya...
What I did know, forgotten, yes.
It’s not the best age I do guess.
I am worn out... - "Tell me, nanny
About olden times of yours...
You were in love, sometimes, of course.”

XVIII

- Ah, Tanya! Never in these times
We heard of love or knew, what’s it,
My mother-in-law otherwise
Would yell at me and then get rid. -
“But tell me, nanny, how’s your wedding?”
- I think it was what God was telling.
I was thirteen years old, you see,
And Vanya younger was than me.
Matchmaker at my home appeared
Not once to deal the marriage, and
My father blessed me in the end.
I shed the tears, was scared and feared,
But they with cry undid by braid,
And singing songs to church conveyed.

XIX

And thus, I switched to a strange being ...
But you’re not listening to me... -
“Ah, nanny, nanny, I am grieving,
I’m giddy, nanny, you can see...
I’m close to weeping, ululating!..”
- My poor child, are you fainting?
Oh, God, have mercy upon us!
If you need something, please, just ask ...
The holly water will help, maybe,
You are in fever... - “Not at all,
I am in love, yes, nanny” - Oh,
I’ll pray to God, and He will save you! -
The nanny said a prayer and
Crossed Tanya with a senile hand.

XX

“I am in love”, - she whispered faintly
To the babushka in despair.
- My bosom fellow, are you healthy? -
“I am in love, please, go away”.
And at that time the moon was shining
By languor light illumining
The inconspicuous charming fair,
Her falling down flowing hair,
And drops of tears, and at the bed
In front of the affected girl
A granny in a quilted coat,
A kerchief on her gray-haired head.
And all around was in dream,
Inspiring moon illumed the scene.

XXI

Tatiana’s soul flew far away,
And looking at the moon she told...
“Leave me alone, please, go away...”
A daring thought at once occurred.
“Give me the pen and paper, nanny,
And move the desk; I will be ready
To go to bed quite soon”. And thus,
She is alone with moon and stars.
Leaned on the desk she something scribbles.
Only Eugene is in her thought,
That’s what the heart of virgin sought.
The hasty letter the love figures.
Now, it is ready, can we see,
Who is Tatiana’s addressee?

XXII

I knew the beauties beyond reaching,
Like winter cold and sovereign,
Implacable, to love resisting,
Incomprehensible for brain;
I wondered at their haughty pride,
Their inborn virtue unconfined,
And I confess escaped from these,
Above their perfect eyebrows is
A dreadful signet of inferno...
Forget your hope forever, guy!
Arousing love for them is crime,
To frighten men for them is clever.
Perhaps sometimes on Neva’s banks
You also saw that breed of cranks.

XXIII

I saw the other whimsy ladies,
Ambitiously unconfined,
Insensitive to sighs and praises
Of the admirers on behind.
And what did me at all that wonder?
By stern behavior they made ground
To frighten timid love at first,
But then to make it even worse.
At least regret they demonstrated,
At least the sounds of their talks
Sometimes aroused the hopeful thoughts,
And being disorientated
Again young lover burned by flame
Tried to chase shade of love in vain.

XXIV

Why is Tatiana guiltier then?
May be because her simple soul
Doesn’t know what is deceit and can
Believe in what her heart has told?
Or since she loves with no dissembling
Completely to her love surrendering,
Since she is trustful and from Heaven
Got a sincere artless talent,
And the inflamed imagination,
The clever mind and soul’s thrill,
An independent lively will,
A heart that beats in tender passion?
And would not you forgive to her
The lightness of the passions whirl?

XXV

Coquette makes judgment in cold mind,
Tatiana manifests in earnest
Her love, abandons like a child,
Whose feels are absolutely honest.
She does not say... I’d better wait,
The price of love by that upgrade.
Will organize a trap and bring
To the seductive nets, then, sting
By vanity, then, hope exciting
By puzzlement the heart disturb
And that by jealousy promote;
Since, when surfeited with delighting,
He would be glad to cast off chain,
Like does a convict in a jail.

XXVI


But here I see another trouble...
To save the honor of my land
I’ll be compelled, and that’s no doubt,
Tatiana’s letter to translate.
To know well Russian she'd no need
And native magazines didn’t read.
About private things to tell
In native language could not well.
And thus, in French she used to write.
What can I do! I repeat...
Till now the female’s love doesn’t need
To be expressed in Russian, right
Till now, it’s not the language, which
Is widely used in letters’ speech.

XXVII

I know, they try to force the ladies
To read in Russian. Ah, my friends!
No one of these I can imagine
With “Russian Journal” in their hands!
I plead to poets... were not really
The pretty subjects, to whom sinning
You wrote in secrecy your rhymes,
Of whom a poet sighs and pines,
To whom your heart you dedicated,
Were poor in Russian language, yet,
Had understood it pretty bad
And so amusingly translated,
And has not they converted now
The stranger tongue into home one?

XXVIII

God save me at a public meeting
Or when departing at the steps
To face an academic being
In yellow shawl or ladies’ hat!
Like with no smile the pretty lips,
I do not like the Russian speech
With no grammatical mistakes.
But maybe sometimes prayers thanks
The beauties’ novel generation
Will native grammar start to learn,
Will understand the Russian term,
And launch the rhymes to operation.
But me... why should it bother me?
I’ll be old-fashioned, yes, I’ll be.

XXIX

Irregular and careless babble,
Inexact accent of the talks
As before stir my heart to tremble,
Remind me my roots and folks.
And to repent I can’t afford
Of Gallicisms I shall be fond
As of the sins of youthful times
And Bogdanovich’s perfect rhymes.
But that’s enough. It’s time for me
To represent my beauty’s letter.
I gave my word. But what’s the matter,
I’m close to stop it, let me see.
I know, that tender Parny’s pen
Does not comply with modern trend.

XXX

The friend of feasts and melancholy,
If you could still remain with me,
I’d ask you for a favor, for me
Interpret what is worth of thee,
And do translate the virgin’s passions
Into the poetry’s expressions.
I call to you, please come and do,
I’ll transfer all my rights to you.
I’ll be so thankful for assistance...
But in the midst of dismal rocks
You have forgotten praise for songs,
You are alone and with persistence
Do stroll under the Finish sky
And do not hear my wistful cry.

XXXI

Tatiana’s letter I look over,
It makes a sacred thing to me,
I read it with a mystic sorrow,
And cannot, cannot stop to read.
Who prompted her this tender passion
And words amicable expression?
Who prompted touching voice to her,
The reckless heart inspired for
This detrimental captive story?
I cannot catch it well, but still
Present to you (that makes me thrill)
A lively picture’s pallid copy,
Performing by the shy school girls
The Weber’s Freischutz at their homes:

Tatiana’s letter to Onegin

I write to you, - what can be further?
What can I tell to you besides?
You may disdain me and moreover
By your neglection penalize.
But maybe you can still discover
A drop of pity in your soul,
You shall not leave my heart alone.
At first I wanted to keep silent;
Believe me, you would never know
My shame, whenever my poor soul
Might hope and just a chance could find
Enjoy your visiting to us,
Not often, maybe weekly, thus,
To see you and to hear your speeches,
To tell few words to you and then
To dream of seeing you again,
To get a chance to watch your features.
You don’t like visits, people say,
In country wilderness you’re boring,
But we… by nothing being famed,
Your visits really enjoying.

Why did you come to visit us?
In backwoods of forgotten hamlet,
I should not know of you and thus,
I should not know the bitter torment.
An inexperienced soul’s excitement
Restrains with lapse of time, at last,
A cordial friend I’d maybe find,
Would be a mother nice and kind,
Would be a husband’s faithful spouse.

Another!.. No, it is quite fatal,
I won’t give up my heart’s adores!
It’s by the heaven’s council settled…
It is a divine will: I’m yours;
Since all my life was just a pledge
Of right appointment with thee;
I know that God, who’s always sage,
Sends you take custody of me…
You came to me in the night visions,
Invisible, you were my dear,
Your lovely gaze impelled my thrill,
Your voice I heard in my illusions
For long … No, that was not a dream!
You just came in, and in a moment
I was astonished, I was burning,
My lips did whisper: it is him!
And wasn’t it you, whom I heard speaking,
In silence you conversed with me,
And wasn’t it you, of whom was thinking
Dispensing alms or when was seeking
To quench by pray grieve burning me?
And in this very-very instant
Was it not you, to whom I listened:
In limpid darkness you flicked up,
As consolation to me whispered
Inspiring words so nice and blissful
And nestled at my head in dark?
Who are you, maybe, guardian angel,
Or cunning tempter sent by devil:
Please, settle my heart hesitation.
But, maybe, all that is worth free
Or just the virgin soul’s frustration!
Another fate is waiting me…
I can’t betray my heart and thus
In front of you I’m shedding tears,
Please, be my guard, whom I do trust,
I beg, do terminate my fears.
Can you imagine, I’m alone,
Nobody here can learn my mind,
My brain gives up escape to find
In the dead silence being drawn.
I'm waiting you: so, do, at once,
Reanimate the heart reliance
Or terminate the gloomy silence
By worthy of reproaching glance!

That’s it! I’m scared to read again…
My heart by shame and fear is dying…
Your honor for me is a bail,
I’m fearlessly on it relying…

XXXII

Tatiana ohhs, and ahhs and sighs,
The letter flickers in her hand,
On inflamed tongue pink sticker dries,
Rereading letter can not end.
Her head has bent to naked shoulder,
A chemise on the neck has folded
Uncovering the charming bend…
Meanwhile, the night comes to its end.
The moon shy dies away, the valley
Clears out through a morning steam.
A creek is silvered by a beam,
A shepherd’s horn far away playing.
The country woke up long ago,
Tatiana doesn’t care, not at all.

XXXIII

She does not notice coming morning,
With droopy head sits at the lamp;
To sign the letter not affording
She dare not seal it with carved stamp.
To press carved signet can’t afford.
The nanny opens bedroom door
And warely steps on squeaky floor;
A cup of tea is on the tray.
“Good morning, darling, time to wake!
But you are already prepared!
Oh, what an early bird, my dear!
Last evening you awoke my fear!
Have you forgotten all your care?
No more night sorrow I can trace
On your like poppy burning face”.

XXXIV

- Ah, nanny, can you give a favor. -
“With pleasure, sweet heart, just direct”.
- Believe me... truly... my behavior...
But look... ah..! Please, do not neglect. -
“My darling, honestly to God!”
- Then send your grandson with this note
To O... Excuse, to this, to whom...
The neighbor, and please do it soon.
He should not say a word, oh, never!
He should not mention there my name! -
“To whom shall I the note convey?
I am so old and no more clever.
There’s plenty neighbors, yes, it is;
I can’t just count all of these”.

XXXV

- How poorly you are witting nanny!
“My cordial friend, but I am old ...
Yes, Tanya, old, and can’t wit sanely,
But sometimes I was keen and bold,
It happened that the nobles willing...”
"Ah, nanny, nanny! Am I really
Concerned with your slow witting mind?
This letter should Onegin find. -
“Oh, yes, that’s perfect, that’s good deal,
Please, don’t be angry with me Tanya,
Forgive my obscured mind kindly...
You’re growing pale again, my dear!”
- No, nanny, nothing, I am not,
Please, send your grandson with this note. -

XXXVI

A day flew by - no reply letter,
The next has come - no reply yet.
She’s pale and worries, what’s the matter,
Since morning dressed awaits for that.
Olga’s admirer came to them,
The hostess asked a question, then...
“Your friend doesn’t visit us for long,
Is he all right, or something wrong?”
Tatiana blushed, began to tremble.
- He promised to be here today,
But maybe’s delayed by the mail. -
Vladimir answered to the granny.
Tatiana felt unreasoned shame
Like hearing someone’s spiteful blame.

XXXVII

It’s getting dark; on table shining
The evening samovar made hiss.
It warmed up tea in pot from China
A light steam swirling under this.
The fragrant tea by dark jet streaming
Poured by the Olga’s hand was filling
Placed on the table china cups;
A boy served creamer; there’s no fuss;
Tatiana at the window standing
Was breathing on a chilly pane
And, pensively, the cherished name
By charming finger was amending...
The sacred monogram E. O.
Erasing inscribed by a blow.

XXXVIII

Meanwhile, her soul was hit by feeling,
The languid glance was full of tears.
But thud of horses' hoofs appearing
Made blood to still, provoked her fears.
“It is Eugene!” And light like shadow,
Tatiana hopped to a back stairway,
From porch to yard she rushed in scare,
She flied, to turn back did not dare.
She ran around in a moment
The grassland, bridges and parterre,
The alley to the lake and there
The lilac’s bushes broke and all that
She flashed across and at the lake
On a park bench obtained escape.

XXXIX

She dropped ... “He’s here, Onegin!
Oh, God, save me, what could he think!”
Her heart by bitter torment flaming
Keeps hope but feels like at a brink;
She shivers with the cheeks aglow,
Strains all her hearing just to know
He’s found her or not, but, yet,
The maids were singing at the bed...
They gathered berries being ordered
To sing in chorus to prevent
Eating host’s berries doing that
And were engaged in song performing.
(That was the locals’ smart invention
For landlords’ property protection!)

We shall decoy a young man
Watching him from far away,
We’ll run off, my sweetheart girls,
And with cherries pelt him, then,
With cherries and raspberries
And redcurrants besides these.
You shouldn’t come to listen to
The songs, which are intimate,
Do not come to gaze at us,
How the virgins entertain.

XL

They sing, but just with no attention
Tatiana listens to their voice,
She is awaiting with impatience,
When will relax heart stirring whirls,
When cheeks aglow will disappear.
But in her breast she feels same stir,
The cheeks just brighter glow and glow,
And burn and burn just more and more...
That’s how a butterfly is shining
Beating in seizures by the wing,
When naughty boy detains poor thing,
That’s how a hare in field is trying
To get escape when at a distance
A hunter threats to its existence.

XLI

But finally a deep sigh heaving,
She dared to leave the hiding site,
Began to walk restraining feeling,
Turned to the alley to the right...
In front of her by glances blazing
Onegin stands like specter shading.
And being shocked like burned by flame
Tatiana at her place remained.
What happened then upon that meeting
I won’t tell you today, my friend,
Though, do not want my tale to end.
I just do need after long speaking
To take a brake and have a rest...
Sometimes will finish it, I guess.


Chapter IV

I

The less you show your love to woman,
The more attractive, thanks to that
Can catch her fancy and then ruin
In well-arranged seductive net.
Coldblooded lechery sometimes
Was celebrated as love science.
They used to relish just the lust
And in the love they did not trust.
But this so serious distraction
Is worth of overmature apes,
Remains in vaunted grandpas’ age...
Today, Lovelace has lost attraction,
The stately wigs' and red heels' fame
Has vanished with the passing day.

VIII

Who wouldn’t be bored to simulate,
Diversely repeat same things,
And looking serious persuade
Of what no one distrusts long since,
To listen to the same objections,
Destroy the prejudice perceptions,
Which never had and never has
A naive girl in thirteen years!
Who wouldn’t be worn by threats and lies,
By seeming fears, by oaths and prayers,
By billet-doux on seven pages,
By gossip, tears, rings, weepy rhymes,
By aunts’ and mothers’ watch and care
And husbands’ friendship so unfair!

IX

That’s what exactly thought Onegin.
In adolescence’s first days
He was seduced by unchecked craving,
Fell victim of the passions plays.
By the life habit pretty spoilt,
With one thing being just annoyed,
With other charmed but not for long,
By the desires slowly gnawed,
Gnawed by a flip success obtaining,
Perceiving in the noise and quiet
Chronic complain of soul insight,
The yawning by the laugh restraining...
That’s how he had killed eight young years,
Which should be all his life’s the best.

X

He stopped to fall in love with beauties,
But dangled after them somehow;
When was declined - no painful duties,
When was deceived - take rest so far.
He searched for them without rapture,
And left just never being captured
Not by affection, nor by spite,
Like listless visitor by night
Is used to go somewhere for gambling.
He starts to play, game over and
He leaves the partners in the end,
At home he sleeps without trembling;
When waking up he does not know,
Where in the evening he will go.

XI

But after Tanya’s note receiving,
Onegin was vividly stirred,
The tongue by which the girl was dreaming
A swarm of thoughts in him conceived.
And he recalled sweetheart Tatiana’s
Dismal appearance and pail colors;
His lonely soul immersed in dream
Into a sweet and sinless stream.
Maybe, the ancient flame of passion
Captured his mind, anyway,
He was not ready to betray
The naive souls’ sincere confession.
Now let us transfer to the place,
Where he met Tanya face to face.

XII

Two minutes they were staying silent,
Onegin, then, came close to her
And said... "You wrote me, don’t deny it,
I’ve read what you have pleaded for...
The trustful naive girl’s confession,
Effusion of your soul’s affection;
Yes, your sincerity is cute,
It stirred my heart for so long mute,
Provoked the silenced feels resembling;
But I don’t want to praise you, yet,
And shall repay to you for that,
Confess like you with no dissembling,
Display my fortune to your view...
Thus, make a judgment and review.

XIII

“Should I want to confine my being
By a home circle like all do,
And should it be my fortune’s willing
To maintain spouse and father’s due,
Should I by family nice picture
Just for a moment can be captured,
Then nobody, but you, I swear,
I’d love to be my lady fair.
I say without lyric tinsel...
Just only you were and could be
The only one, whom I would see
As girlfriend of my sad existence,
You’d be a pledge of good to me,
I would be happy... as could be!

XIV

“But I was born not for a pleasure;
It’s what my soul does not accept;
In vain are all your priceless treasures,
I am not worth of that, I bet.
Believe me (conscience is my bail)
The marriage for us will make jail.
However much I’d love you now,
Will get used to and stop to love;
You’ll start to weep, but tears of yours
Will not at all disturb my soul,
But stir up rage and make it boil.
Thus, you can judge, what bunch of rose
Will bring to us these Hymen’s plays,
And probably for many days.

XV

“I can’t imagine worse than find
A family, where a poor wife
Regrets for an unworthy husband
Staying alone the day and night;
Where a dull husband knows her value,
Yet, saying nothing but God damn you,
Is always frowning, taciturn,
Poisoned by jealousy and stern!
Am I the one you did search for,
You, who are flaming, smart and clear,
With whom you dared to be sincere,
To whom you wrote with burning soul?
And are you ready to accept
This so much awful cruel fate?

XVI

“The dreams and years have passed, another
I can’t get and my soul update...
I love you by a love of brother
And maybe tenderly than that.
Please listen to me with no temper...
I’m not an evil virgins tempter,
One dream will change the other ones,
Like sapling changes leaves not once,
According to the seasons, yearly.
That’s by the heaven predestined.
You’ll fell in love again. Same time...
You should control yourself, be wary.
Don’t do again same thing you did,
The innocence can trouble bring”.

XVII

That’s how Onegin moralized.
Tatiana listened to his preach;
She didn’t object, tears in the eyes,
And dare not interrupt his speech.
He stretched his arm, and she with sorrow
Like in the absent mind followed
His gesture, and leaned on his hand
Declining languid head at that;
And they went home circling the garden;
Appeared together, and no one
Did try to blame them for the done...
The country’s morals become rather
Broad-minded, there’s no reproach,
Pomp Moscow shows the same approach.

XVIII

You should agree with me, my reader,
Onegin was quite fair and nice
With Tanya, who was too sincere.
Not for the first time he surprised
Me by his noble soul’s perfection,
Though ill-willed people's imperfection
Forgave him nothing, I can tell...
The enemies and friends, as well
(And these are probably same matter)
Were cursing him this way and that.
You can't make everybody glad,
My God, please save us from the latter,
The so called friends! And not in vain
I do remind you of them!

XIX

And what? Don’t worry. I calm down
These fruitless and so gloomy dreams;
In brackets only I mark out
There’re no such lie or dirty tricks
Born at a garret by a liar
And by the public mobs inspired,
There’re no such nonsense, such a froth,
Or epigram the garbage worth,
Which among men of upright fashion
Your best friend with a smile not once
Did not reiterate by chance
Without malice or intention;
But he will beat for you his breast...
He loves you like your kinfolk, yes!

XX

Well, well! My kind noble reader,
Are all your kinfolk in good health?
I beg your pardon, are you ready,
I'll now explain it by myself,
What does the kinfolk in fact mean.
I give my definition here...
We must respect them and be fair,
Caress and take of them good care,
And must arrange the Christmas meetings,
Since that complies with people’s rites,
Or mail them postcards otherwise
With best regards and other greetings.
Then, all the rest time of the year
They won’t disturb you. Yes, take care!

XXI

However, love of tender pretties
Is safer than of friends and kin...
No one requires to relinquish
The rights, when sudden storms begin.
That’s true, of course. But whirl of fashion,
Besides, the nature’s self-expression,
The high society’s views and mind...
And pretty sex like fluff is flying.
Opinion of a husband, then,
By a good willed and sinless wife
Should always be respected, right?
Thus, your reliable girl friend
In flash can be enticed away...
Yes, Satan likes with love to play!

XXII

Whom can you trust? Where love can find?
Who’ll never cheat you or betray?
Who’s always positive and kind,
And only good to you will say?
Who does not sow a bitter slander,
Who’s with you always nice and tender?
To whom your vice is not a trouble?
Who won’t annoy, like does the other?
Are you a seeker for a shadow?
Don’t spend your energy in vain,
But love yourself and don’t complain,
Enjoy yourself my dear fellow!
That is a subject best of all!
You want say thank you? - Not at all!

XXIII

And what resulted from the meeting?
Alas! It’s easy to divine!
The reckless adoration feeling
Could not relax or pacify.
She can’t learn an escape for soul.
No, faithful to the passion’s vow,
Tatiana burns in feeling’s flame,
She does not sleep, her face turns pale.
Her blossom, health and vivid feeling,
Her smile and modest virgin grace
All disappears like empty phrase,
And Tanya’s charming youth is chilling...
Thus, stormy shade eclipses light
Of starting day, which looked so bright.

XXIV

Alas, Tatiana now is fading,
She’s pale, extinct and always quiet!
Nothing can make her entertaining,
And nothing can her soul excite.
The neighbors shaking pompous heads
Discuss the matter, heave the breaths,
Give the advice... it’s time for marriage!...
But that’s enough to relish ravage.
To entertain imagination
By picture of a happy love
I shall start now, though all above
(Despite well-reasoned deprecation)
I place Tatiana’s vivid feels.
I do love her, excuse me please!

XXV

Young Vladimir is fascinated
By Olga’s merits more and more
His ardent heart is captivated
By her good looks and kind soul.
He’s always with her. In her room
They sit in front like bride and groom,
And in the garden like close friends
Stroll every morning holding hands.
And what? By the love saturated
And being disarrayed and shy
He only rarely dares to try
By Olga’s nice smile animated
Her ringlet bashfully to twist
Or the long dress’s trim to kiss.

XXVI

It happens, he recites to Olya
A sentimental moral tale,
Where author knows the nature more than
Chateaubriand used to explain.
When doing that, two or three pages,
(Frivolous blather, idle fables
Unsafe for hearts of virgin girls)
He skips and flushing red, then, turns.
And hiding far away from people
They sit and look at a chessboard
And feel quite lonely in their world,
Where nothing can disturb or hit them;
And Lensky wandering in drowse
By pawn takes rook, but not of hers.

XXVII

When coming home, at home as well
He dreams of Olga all the time.
His albums’ sheets were very well
Embellished with the paints and rhymes...
He draws an ancient Venus tomb,
The country view and sad gravestone,
A little pigeon on a lyre
Depicts by pen and colors fine;
Then on the sheets with recollections,
Below the others’ words and signs,
He leaves his sentimental rhymes,
A speechless monument to passions,
The instant ballad’s long-term trace
That is the same for many years.

XXVIII

You did see and not once, no doubt,
An album of exalted girl
That was inscribed from top around
By girlfriends’ oeuvres overall,
Right here, orthography defying,
They were their feelings signifying...
As a keepsake they used to rhyme,
Extend, then brief and then combine.
There, on the first sheet, you are meeting...
Qu' ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
And signet t. a v. Annette;
And on the last one you are reading...
“Who loves you more than I do thee
Should attempt writing after me”.

XXIX

Indeed, on these sheets you will find
The burning torch, two hearts and bloom,
The adjuration will remind...
I’m loving you to edge of doom;
Some poetaster from armed forces
Had scribbled here the obscene verses.
It is an album, where, my friends,
I’d love to write with no restraints.
Yes, in my soul there is no doubt
That all the rubbish I write now
Will still deserve somebody’s bow,
They won’t with malice grin spell out
And with a swagger analyze
How smart I was when telling lies.

XXX

But you, so odd and scattered volumes
From the infernal library,
And you, superbly looking albums,
The throe of poetastery,
The scripts by Tolstoy animated,
By his brush nimbly decorated
Or marked by Baratynsky’s pen,
I wish you’d burned by thunder bang!
And when a splendid noble lady
Her nice in-quarto hands to me,
I'm shuddering in rage, you see ;
It irritates and makes me angry;
An epigram stirs in my soul,
But they, ...for madrigals they call!

XXXI

But in the album of young Olga
Vladimir writes not madrigals;
He does not wit by remarks coldly,
His pen by adoration smiles;
All stuff that he is hearing, seeing
About Olga he is limning,
The elegies gush out of him
Full of live verity by stream.
That’s how Yazykov instigated
By noble impulses of soul
Presents the elegies’ rich row,
Just Lord knows whom he’s celebrated.
There, maybe sometimes he will read
The story of the life he lived.

XXXII

But hush! You hear? A critic strictly
Commands from elegy take off
The wrath of sound mind quickly,
At poetasters yells... “do stop
To weep, to cry and like a frog
Reiterate one and same croak,
Regret for past and for bygone;
Enough, please, sing another song!”
- Yes, you are right indeed requiring
To recollect pipe, mask and blade,
The mortal phantoms resurrect -
These are dead treasures you’re inspiring!
Am I correct, my dear milords?
“Not, yet! Please, do compose the odes,

XXXIII

Like used to be in the best time,
Like was established by the olds...”
- You just the solemn odes require!
Enough, my friend, enough, no odds!
Remember, what did say satirist!
Does foreign fashion cunning lyrist
Annoy us less than use to do that
A doleful native so-called poet? -
“But all in elegy is poor,
Its idle purpose makes no sense.
Purpose of ode makes high expense,
It's noble..." Here I could, for sure,
Argue with you, but won’t do that,
To clash two centuries I hate.

XXXIV

In stir of stormy reckless thoughts,
By liberty and glory pleased,
Vladimir would love to write odes,
But Olga was not fond of these.
Did ever any weepy poet
Use to declaim his solemn poem
To his beloved? I heard, they said,
There’s no best award he could get.
Blessed is a modest lover really,
When reading passions of his soul
Devoting his poetic song
To his fair lady, nice and pleasing!
He’s blessed... But, maybe, at that time
She feels indifferent to rhyme?

XXXV

My fruits of reveries effusion
And of the lyre harmonic plays
I read to nanny in seclusion,
She is a friend of my young days,
And also sometimes gnaw a neighbor,
Who comes to share my boring table,
By reading to him tragic book
Have caught his suit flap in the nook.
Or else, and here without jesting,
By rhythms and anguish being pined
I stroll and nobody can find
A lonely lake, where darks are nesting,
Where heeding my sonorous strophes
The flocks of darks from banks fly off.

XXXVI XXXVII

I shall request for your excuse...
His everyday routine and studies
I shall in detail introduce.
Onegin lived like real hermit,
He waked up early in the morning,
And after waking straight from bed
Walked to the river lightly clad.
By singer of Corsair inspired,
This Hellespont he swam across,
Then, coffee drank and in a drowse
To read a magazine desired,
And, then, he dressed...

XXXVIII XXXIX

The walks, deep sleep, relax and reading,
The forest’s shade and waters’ hiss,
Sometimes an unsuspected meeting
And a dark-eyed blonde’s charming kiss.
Riding a steed to bridle obedient,
A tasteful lunch, when it’s convenient,
A bottle of a nice white wine,
And calm, and solitary time.
That is Onegin’s sacred living.
And he, indifferent to passions,
Gave up to summer days impressions,
Enjoyed this careless languor being,
Forgot the city and his friends,
And boredom of the feast events.

XL

But in my north, the summer season
Just mimics south winter, yes...
Flashed on and off, though despite reason
It’s what we scarcely would confess.
The sky was breathing by the autumn
The sun was shining not so often,
And shorter had become the day,
The groves were getting dull and bare.
It makes you sad, calms down feelings.
The fog laid on the bottom lands,
And in the sky geese caravans
With cries flied south. Summer’s leaving.
A boring season at threshold;
November brought first snow and cold.

XLI

A dawn gets up in chilly shadow,
The noise of works in fields has died;
A wolf chased by his hungry fellow
At the main road appears at night.
A driving horse has scented trouble
And snorts; the rider being worried
Speeds at full tilt in a great fear;
At dawn, a shepherd at the hill
Doesn’t push the cows from shed for feeding,
And does not play in the midday
His pipe to call them from away;
A maid in hut a thread is spinning;
She’s singing, friend of winter nights -
A splinter crackles smokes and lights.

XLII

The biting frost the nature froze,
The spacious fields are shining silver...
(Here you expect a rhyme with rose;
Yes, take it please, my eager reader!)
The river shines in ice attiring
And looks more neat than parquet tiling.
The joyful nation of the boys
Is skating on the ice with noise;
A goose on reddish feet decided
To swim across the water world;
He steps on ice with care, and what?
He slides and falls; the first snow flying
Is twinkling, spinning by the whirls,
And by the stars falls on the shores.

XLIII

In backwoods, what to do this season?
To take a stroll? The country view
Does not produce attractive vision
By nakedness annoying you.
To ride horseback in severe steppes?
A horse can fall when making steps
On slippery and icy ground;
You’d better stay in safe surround.
In lonely indoors enjoy reading,
Here’s Pradt, and here is Walter Scott.
Don’t want to read? - Then, prices quote,
Get angry, drink, get pleased by eating.
And anyhow the day is over,
You’re looking for the same tomorrow.

XLIV

Like Childe Harold looks Onegin,
In pensive lazy mood remains...
He takes an ice bath after waking,
And in his nook spends all the days.
Alone, immersed in estimation,
Devoid of any animation,
Just after leaving morning drowse
He’s playing billiard with two balls.
And when the country night is coming,
He leaves pool room, puts cue aside,
Arranges table at fireside.
Onegin waits... here’s Lensky driving,
The troika roans have pulled the sledge.
It’s dinner time for country sage!

XLV

Widow Clicquot or famous Moet,
The divine wine is always blessed,
In frozen bottle for the poet
It’s on the table quickly placed.
It sparkles like a sacred spring
(And, thus, reminds me something).
The sprinkling bubbles and the foam
Imprison me. Not long ago
I used to spend my last one lepton
To get it. I retain, my friends,
How it’s majestic sprinkling jets
Making a lively cheering fountain
Gave rise to many silly things,
The disputes, verses, cheerful dreams!

XLVI

But gushing out hissing foam
Disturbs my stomach, that is why
To be more modest I prefer
And drink Bordeaux - a prudent wine.
I cannot handle Ai more,
It’s not the thing I’m searching for,
Ai is similar to lover -
Impatient, frivolous and wayward.
But you, Bordeaux, like a close friend,
Who, both, in trouble and in sorrow,
The other day, today, tomorrow
Did, do and always will extend
The welcome hand and share pastime.
Hurrah, Bordeaux, best friend of mine!

XLVII

The flame is dying, by the ashes
Are lightly covered golden coals,
And by the slightly noticed splashes
A steam is swirling making coils.
The chimney gives the final sighs,
The smoke from pipes in chimney dies,
A goblet makes a final hiss,
The dark is falling like a mist...
(I love the friendly idle speeches
And friendly goblet of the wine
At that night period of time,
Which people in the country features
As between wolf and dog). That’s fine.
About what they talk this time?

XLVIII

“How are the neighbors? How’s Tatiana?
How’s frisky Olga spending time?”
- Please, pour me half a glass more, brother...
Enough, my darling... They are fine
And healthy, send regards to you.
Ah, darling, Olga is so pure!
Look at her shoulders and her breast,
She is just blooming! Someday let’s
Go visit them; they will be pleased.
You know, my friend, how can it be...
You dropped in twice, and disappeared.
They don’t deserve to be displeased.
Oh, how could I forget, Goddamn!
Next week you should go visit them. -

XLIX

“And what?” - Tatiana’s name-day party,
On Saturday. My dear and mom
Want see you; yes, you are invited,
This time you shouldn’t neglect the call. -
 “A lot of people will be there,
Ragtag and bobtail, that’s nightmare...”
- Nobody will be there like that!
Only the family, I bet.
Let’s do it, please, give me a favor.
So, what? - “All right”. - You are so nice! -
And saying that he drained a glass
And did it to the health of neighbor.
Then, they began to talk again
Of love, of Olga, all the same!

L

And he was joyful being glad
That in two weeks he’ll earn the treasure -
A secret of the nuptial bed,
The wrath of love and of lust pleasure
His flaming soul will shortly find.
And what did never learn his mind,
It’s Hymen’s bonds and monotone,
The troubles, boredom and so on.
To tell the truth, I hate Hymen,
And domesticity don’t like,
The boring pictures only sight
As was described by Lafontaine...
But my poor Lensky... yes, he was
Conceived for all these dreams and drowse.

LI

He thought he’s loved, and in his mind
Remained quite happy. Blessed is that,
Who is by naive faith inspired,
Who the cold mind can distract,
In sweet oblivion is resting,
Like drunken wayfarer is nesting,
Or, gently, like a morning moth,
That sucks the flower’s sap off;
But pitiful is who foresees,
Who can’t be captured by the feelings,
Who all the movements, all the readings
Disdains, subjects to expertise,
Who by experience is chilled,
And by the common sense is willed!

Chapter V

I

It was a year, when autumn weather
Had occupied the world for long.
For winter nature craved, however,
Only in January it snowed.
Tatiana wakened in the morning
Was watching how the snow was falling.
It’d covered all the countryside,
The sheds and roofs, the fence and yard.
The panes by ice were decorated,
By silver were embellished trees,
The magpies were enjoying this,
The hills were by snow cover plated.
The winter finally has come,
And fascinates by bliss and calm.

II

IIt’s winter! And a solemn peasant
Is laying pathway on a sleigh.
His horse scents snow and looking pleasant
Is slowly trotting in some way.
The fluffy furrows pushing high
A dashing cart is speeding by;
In a sheepskin with red sash tied
A coachman sits on a cart’s height.
On a snowed road a boy is running.
He pulls a sled like is a horse
And drives a doggy at full force;
He’s frosted finger, but it’s funny,
Despite the pain he doesn’t stop play;
His mother gestures from away.

III

But, maybe, pictures of that kind
Do not make interest to you,
Since they of primitive remind
And don’t depict a gorgeous view.
By god of inspiration blessed
Another poet earned success,
In gorgeous style first snow described
And winter’s splendid bliss admired.
He’ll fascinate you, beyond doubt,
Depicting by his ardent rhymes
The secret winter troika’s rides;
But insofar, I see no ground
To strive with him or whom you know
As pretty Finish young girl’s beau!

IV

Tatiana (purely Russian creature,
Though, did not know, why is it so)
Adorned by the cold beauty’s features
Admired Russian winter, snow
And hoarfrost in a sunny day,
The sleigh rides and a late dawn play,
When snow is painted in pink color,
And Christmas eve’s majestic cover.
By ancient rite they celebrated
These eves at home and all the maids
From all the Larina’s estates
Were used to guess what’s to them fated,
And to Tatiana every year
Promised far trip and cavalier.

V

Tatiana trusted in the legends
Retained in common people’s rite,
In dreams, card-reading by the maidens,
The prophecies by the moon’s sight.
Her soul by omens was disturbed,
And all the subjects she observed
Something unclear did suggest,
Presentiments constrained her chest.
A mincing cat on stove is staying,
It purrs and washes snout by leg...
No doubt, it’s the omen that
The guests are coming. And when staring
At bicorn new moon’s pretty face,
Exactly on the left hand place,

VI

She started shivering and paling.
And when a falling star in sky
Making it’s quiet magic sailing
Dispersed still being in a fly,
Tatiana in confusion hurried
To whisper what her heart desired,
Unless the star was still in flight.
And when it happened her to sight
A black monastic on the way
Or a fast hare crossing a road
Among the fields she had to hold,
She didn’t know what to do in scare;
And full of premonitions, sad,
She was awaiting something bad.

VII

You know, Tatiana found relish
Even in absolutely dread...
That’s what the nature has established
To contradictions being glad.
The Christmastide has come. All fine!
For fortune telling its prime time.
It entertains the adolescents,
Who have not learned the being lessons
And think that life is light forever.
The same through glasses do the olds,
Who now are reaching the gravestones
And will gain nothing, never ever;
But all the same, to them the hope
Is lying by a baby talk.

VIII

Tatiana by a curious look
Watches the wax sunk in the water.
A finely molded magic hook
Promises to her something obscure.
And on a silver water pane
The rings appear by magic train;
And one of these she’s taking out,
When ancient song to her announced...
“The peasants there are rich and wealthy,
They shovel silver by a spade;
He, whom I sing, is a good mate,
I glory him!” Yet, not be healthy
It promises; because of that
The maids prefer The Pussy Cat.

IX

The night is frosty, sky is clear,
The lamps of night on magic dome
By divine train in calm appear.
Tatiana to the yard from home
Is coming out in light clothing,
A mirror to the moon is turning.
The moon is showing its pale face
In the dark glass, and nothing else.
Hark... snow is squeaking ... passerby;
To him on tiptoe Tanya speeds;
Her voice in dark just sings, not speaks,
It is more tender than of pipe...
What is your name? He’s looking on
And gives an answer... Agafon.

X

Tatiana on advice of nanny
Intended reading cards at night,
In secret she arranged in banya
A fortune telling lonely site.
But sudden fear has seized Tatiana...
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Feel feared as well and that is why
To tell her fortune dare not try.
A sash of silk the girl took off;
Undressed and slipped into a bed,
Lel spins and twists above her head.
I wonder what she’s dreaming of.
It’s calm; under a downy pillow
There is a fortune telling mirror.

XI

About what is dreaming Tanya?
She’s dreaming that she’s quite alone,
Walks by a clearing’s snowy cover
Like in a doleful shadow drawn;
In the snowdrifts on Tanya’s way
Makes noise and splashes by the wave
With ice not bonded gray-haired stream.
It runs and bubbles making steam.
Two thin poles bonded by the ice
Provide a shaky baleful cross;
They lay above the fatal fosse.
She stops at it and puzzled tries
To guess appropriate escape,
But no decision she can make.

XII

Tatiana murmurs at the spring
Perceiving it as separation;
She fails to find anything
That can resolve her hesitation.
But suddenly a snowdrift moved,
And what was it in snowdrift’s groove?
A bear, a big disheveled bear;
Tatiana ah! What a night mare!
But it a paw with sharp long claws
Extended to her; she with caution
Decided to accept this option
And with a fear leaned on the paw.
She crossed the stream and went ahead,
But hears behind the bear’s step!

XIII

She’s scared to look behind and
Avoids to glance at scary shaggy.
She promptly quickens hasty gait,
But cannot get rid of the lackey.
The awful bear groans, falls the trees,
It’s doing that and does not cease.
The pines are rising to the skies,
Their branches by decor of ice
Are loaded, and the lamps of night
Are beaming brightly through the branches
Of naked birches, ashes, aspens.
There is no road in thicket site,
The bushes, chutes and all of those
By blizzard snowed stay in a drowse.

XIV

Tatiana to the forest dashes;
The bear behind, she’s in fear;
Here a long bough her collar catches,
There golden earring drops from ear.
Here, a deep snow pulls of a boot
From her so lovely little foot;
There, being in a panic haste
She drops a handkerchief; to waste
Even few seconds she cannot,
Since hears behind the bear’s breathing;
Her heart is trembling, she is seeking
For an escape, and all for naught.
She’s running, but it chases her,
And she has no force to run more.

XV

She falls on snow; the bear doesn’t wait,
It grabs her quickly and speeds on;
She is afraid a breath to take,
Her heart has sunk, she’s scared to turn.
It speeds; now on a forest way
There is a cabin roofed with hay;
Thickets around, dark and snow,
The cot in mystery is drawn.
The light is shining in the window,
She hears the strangers’ cries and noise.
The bear announced... stay with those,
Here is my friend, have a good evening!
It opens squeaky entrance door
And puts Tatiana on the floor.

XVI

She’s come to senses, looks and sees...
There is no bear, she’s in a lobby.
Behind a door the cries and clinks,
Like at a burial ceremony.
Not understanding what it is,
She peeps through chink, and what she sees?
The beasts are sitting at the table;
They cry and noise like in a fable.
One with the horns and doggy muzzle,
The other with a rooster’s head,
A witch with beard behaves like mad,
Here something making just a puzzle,
A dwarf with tail and besides that
A half a crane and half a cat.

XVII

The others are more odd, more scary...
A crawfish sits on spider’s head,
A goose’s neck a scull does carry,
Which spins inside a reddish hat;
A windmill flaps and cracks by wings
And in a squat dance jumps and spins.
Bark, laughter, singing, whistle, scamper,
And people’s talk, and horses’ clatter!
But who is sitting over there,
Among the monsters and the beasts?
Yes, Tanya my tale’s hero sees,
Whom she adores, who causes scare!
Onegin is among them sitting
And at the door furtively flicking.

XVIII

He gives a sign - gets what asks for,
He drinks - the same does all the gang,
He starts to laugh - and they guffaw,
He starts to frown - they make a brake.
He is a master, it is clear,
And Tanya does not feel so feared,
And feeling braver and less shy
She’s peeping through the door ajar...
But suddenly a wind did puff,
And all the lights at once blue out,
The gang of beasts the girl has found.
Onegin pushes off the stuff.
The company gets up and waits,
The master to the door directs.

XIX

And she is scared and is attempting
To run away, but can’t do that.
She is in panic, close to fainting
And tries to cry, but fails to get
Away. Door opens, Eugene looks,
As well as all infernal spooks,
At the poor virgin; they guffaw,
Their gazes are just burning her.
The hoofs and awful crooked trunks,
The fearful tusks and violent fangs,
The whiskers, horns and crested tails,
The bony fingers, bloody tongs,
All these are pointed to her,
They shout... mine! And all guffaw.

XX

It’s mine! announced Eugene sternly,
The gang flashed on and disappeared.
And only the young girl stands lonely
With Eugene by the dark concealed.
Onegin gently brings Tatiana
To seclude corner and puts down
On an unsteady shaky bed,
And on her shoulder bends his head...
All of a sudden Olga enters,
Then, Lensky comes; the light flashed on;
Onegin raised his hand with moan,
His eyes express an evil sentence,
He swears the uninvited guests;
In bed Tatiana half-live rests.

XXI

The quarrel flares, all of a sudden
A long sharp knife in Eugene’s hand
Flashed coldly and a victim found,
Threw down Lensky, after that
Someone hysterically cried.
All disappeared... Tatiana sighed.
She looks around - all is fine.
The frozen panes of windows shine
By crimson beams of the sunrise.
Door opens; who’s there? Olga calling;
She’s worth of this amazing morning,
Gets inside like a swallow flies.
“How are you? Fine, then, tell me please,
Whom did you see in your night dreams?”

XXII

The elder does not see the minor
And with a book still stays in bed,
She turns one page after another,
All her attention switched to that.
We know, this book does not depict
Neither a honey poet’s think,
Nor a wise truth or a nice scene
Composed by Virgil or Racine,
Or Scott, or Byron or Seneca,
Yet, wasn’t it Ladies Magazine,
We wonder what she’s looking in.
My friends, it was Martyn Zadeka,
Chaldean sage, who clarifies
Meaning of dreams and other signs.

XXIII

It was a country migrant merchant,
Who came to the estate sometimes
And this invaluable creation
Brought with a bunch of other wise
And entertaining books, at that
To them a great discount made...
Gave up for three and point five!
Besides, for them he also hired
A set of vulgar folkish fables,
Two Petriadas, grammar, then
The volume three by Marmontel.
Martin Zadeka was the famous,
With him Tatiana always sleeps,
It comforts and the sorrow treats.

XXIV

She is disturbed by her night dreaming.
She wants to know what does it sign,
What is this fearful dreaming meaning?
That’s what she tries to clarify.
Tatiana in a brief contents
Checks for the words complied with sense...
Pine forest, shadow, tempest, gale,
Witch, hedgehog, snowdrift, cot, fir, bear.
But all in vain, Martyn Zadeka
Cannot resolve misgivings, yet,
Sad premonitions does preset,
The future troubles would be fatal.
And for a few days after that
She couldn’t this awful dream forget.

XXV

The sunrise stretches crimson arm
To rise the sun from morning vale,
Besides, it starts the joy and fun -
Tatiana’s January name-day!
Since early morning Larin’s manor
Is full of guests... the friends and neighbors
Have come by carriages, by cabs,
By hooded carts, by open sleds.
In a front room it’s crush and bustle,
And in a drawing room they meet
Newcomers; all of them they greet.
Barking of pugs, noise, laughter, hustle,
Bows, misses' kisses, shuffling, jam,
The kids’ and nurses’ cries and cram.

XXVI

Accompanied by portly spouse
Has arrived stout Triflyakoff,
Gvozdin - a landlord fair and nice,
The owner of the pauper serfs,
The Beastoffs couple, gray and sage,
With children of the plural age
(From two to thirty years of old),
Then, local dandy Roosteroff,
My uncle’s son Mr. Ruffianoff
In down and in a peaked hat
(I bet, for sure, you know that),
And ex-advisor Mr. Flyanoff -
A heavy gossip, old buffoon,
Bribe taker, glutton and fair fool.

XXVII


Here’s family of Pygmykoff
Accompanied by French Trike -
Wise cracker, newly from Tambov,
In glasses and fake reddish hair.
Like real French, he in his pocket
To Tanya brought a famous couplet,
The one, which even kids did hear...
Reveillez-vous, belle endormie.
On almanac’s by time worn pages
This couplet sometimes he observed
And had decided... it deserved
To be extracted from the ages.
And there, instead of oh, belle Nina
Inserted boldly oh, belle Tania.

XXVIII

And, wow! From local town’s suburb
A company commander comes,
For mature maidens he is superb
Inspiring hopes of local mums.
Gets in... and what a thrill he’s stirring...
He’s brought the orchestra, no kidding!
Yes, it will play! It was the colonel,
Who gave the necessary order!
The misses frisk expecting something.
But meal is served, and in a row
The guests proceed to dining-hall.
The girls are at Tatiana hustling;
The men in front; the crowd drones,
And crossing to the table goes.

XXIX

The talks are postponed for a while;
The mouths chew, and in the room
The dishes clatter and the wine
Streams in the glasses clinking cool.
But little by little and the quiet
Was changed by overall excite.
Nobody hears; the noise and shouts,
They argue, laugh, make funny sounds.
All of a sudden Lensky enters,
Onegin follows after him;
The mistress shouts... “Oh, my dear!”
The guests start moving to sit denser;
They shift the glasses, dishes, chairs
To put the friends at the right place.

XXX

They place them opposite my dear,
Who is like morning moonlight pale
And feared like a chased fallow deer;
To glance at him she does not dare;
She is in fever, she’s amazed,
She feels unwell, her breast high raised.
Poor girl doesn’t hear the two friends’ greeting;
She’s suffocating, heavy breathing;
The tears are close to drop from eyes,
She’s close to fall into a faint.
But will and mind had prevailed,
And, thus, she finally pronounced
Through set teeth just a couple words,
And remained sitting afterwards.

XXXI

The tragic-nervous demonstrations,
The ladies’ faints and bitter tears
Stirred in Eugene just no reactions,
He had experienced lots of these.
The stranger at this giant feast
Was irritated besides this;
He noticed languid maiden’s burst,
His glance under the table cast,
And in a sulk made a decision
And vowed that he will take revenge
And Lensky properly enrage.
And now rejoicing in his vision
The future triumph coming soon
Inwardly drew the guests cartoon.

XXXII

Not only my Eugen of course
Saw poor Tatiana’s perturbation,
But fatty pasty that time was
In epicenter of attention
(Unfortunately over-salted).
And, wow, they bring so nicely bottled
Chilled sparkling wine; yes, it was served
Between beefsteak and cold dissert
And was escorted by the glasses
Slender and long like waist of thee...
Zizi, do you remember me?
You were a subject of my verses,
Whom I remember and admire,
And who with no wine could inspire!

XXXIII

A bottle made a loud pop,
Got rid of humid cork, and wine
Is making hiss; Trike can’t stop
To chew the couplet in his mind;
Stands up adopting pompous bearing,
The guests in silence wait his saying.
Tatiana feels like a half dead;
Trike with paper in his hand
Starts singing falsely. Splashes, screaming
Reward the singer. Tanya can’t
Avoid to drop a curtsy; and
The poet, who is great and pleasing,
Is first to drink to Tanya’s health
And hands to her his pearl himself.

XXXIV

Regards, congratulations, speeches,
Tatiana’s thanks for all of that...
But when the turn Onegin reaches,
The maiden's face looked so much sad,
So much confused and so fatigued
That pity in his soul conceived...
He stood up, gave a bow to her
In silence complementing, though
His gaze was wonderfully pensive;
It looked like he was really moved,
Though, play or pranks I can’t exclude,
But it was really expressive,
Involuntary or good willed.
Tatiana’s heart he really stirred.

XXXV

The chairs are moved and in a squeeze
In drawing room the people crowds,
Like from a hive a swarm of bees
Is flying to the blooming grounds.
And being pleased by festive table
A neighbor sniffs in front a neighbor,
The ladies sit by fireside,
The damsels whisper getting quiet;
The green card tables are extended
And call the boisterous old man
To ombre, Boston, whist, as well,
Which till today is highly valued.
What can I tell you of these games...
They are the greedy boredom’s heirs.

XXXVI

The fans of whist eight rubbers played,
In other words, twenty four rounds,
And thus, eight times positions changed.
And tea is served; and I have found...
It’s nice to check the time of day,
By breakfast, dinner and tea brake;
That’s how the country fuss without
Replaces Breguet watch by stomach;
And, by the way, I note in brackets
That in my rhymes you often meet
The scenes of dinners and of feast,
The dishes, corks and petty matters.
That is, by what divine Homer
Impresses us three thousand years!

XXXVII XXXVIII XXXIX

But tea is served... the maidens slowly
The cups on saucers just picked up,
When suddenly somewhere from doorway
Bassoon and flute at once did start.
Being by music roar inspired,
The tea with liquor has exiled
Paris of all the local place,
Rusteroff, Olga calls to dance,
Lensky - to Tanya, Pygmykova,
The over mature fiance,
Is engaged by Tambov’s Trike,
Ruffianoff speeds by Triflyakova.
The hall is crowded with the guests,
The ball is shining in the best.

XL

In the beginning of my tale
(Please, note the chapter number one)
I planned like Alban to explain
How at the balls the nobles fun.
Yet, entertained by hollow dreams
(The recollection interferes)
Depicted charming females’ legs
Of pretty girls and well known dames.
Oh, legs, enough to dream of you!
The youthful bliss has passed forever
I should be wise, I should be clever,
The deals and rhymes I shall review.
And now, in chapter number five
I shouldn’t digressions exercise.

XLI

Monotonous and always thoughtless,
Like whirl of passionate young years,
The waltz is spinning, by the circles
The couples flicker in the dance.
The vengeance time accelerating,
Completing evil undertaking
Onegin comes to Olga, then
To whirl with her at guests began,
Then on a padded chair her places
And starts to talk of this of that.
Two minutes later after that
The end of waltz with her he dances.
All are amazed, Lensky surprised
And can’t believe to his own eyes.

XLII

Mazurka started. I remember,
How it did thunder in a hall,
When the environment did tremble,
The parquet uttered loud groan,
The glasses tinkled in the frames;
No more, however, nowadays,
We like the ladies glide the boards.
But at the province town's courts
Mazurka still is in the prime,
And to the front till now it places
Moustaches, hills and special graces.
It is the same, the passing time
Cannot change that despite of fashion,
Which kills the old with no compassion.

XLIII XLIV

Ruffianoff, who’s my ardent brother,
Both sisters brings to my Eugene,
But he, at that, prefers the minor,
And she agrees to dance with him.
He slides with her and whispers something,
And bends to her with ardor glancing,
Recites poor madrigal, shows charm,
And squeezes gently Olga’s arm.
He has brought her to exaltation,
Her cheeks and neck like roses flare.
But Lensky blushed, could not that stay...
He’s jealous, flushed by indignation,
And finally, when music ends,
Invites her to cotillion dance.

XLV

But she can’t do it. No? But why?
Since to Eugene she gave her word.
How could it be, she looked so shy!
What does he hear, my God, my Lord!
Is she a baby or coquette?
What shall he do with all of that!
To be so cunning, to betray,
To be unfaithful, who would say!
And Lensky can’t withstand the stroke.
He curses women's pranks and tricks,
Gets out fast, to his steed springs
And gallops being deadly shocked.
Two bullets only now await -
They will resolve the poet’s fate.


Chapter VI

I

Had noticed that Vladimir vanished
Onegin was by boredom chased
And being satisfied by vengeance
Began to think of something else.
And Olga too had started yawning,
Cotillion was so long and boring,
It languished her like troubling dream;
Why did Vladimir disappear?
The dance was over; supper followed,
And they arranged for staying guests
Night lodging and a place to rest
From maiden’s room to lobby hallway.
Since people need to have repose;
Onegin left for home, of course.

II

The guests calmed down... in the study
Is snoring heavy Triflyakoff
Accompanied by sweetheart body.
Ruffianoff, Gvozdin, Rusteroff
And Flyanov, being not fine fettle,
In dining room on chairs have settled.
Trike is lying on the floor
In the old cap and camisole.
In rooms of Olga and Tatiana
The maidens are embraced by dreams,
Just Tanya isn’t among of these.
She’s at the window, and Diana
Illuminates her doleful face;
She’s looking at an obscure space.

III

Onegin’s sudden apparition,
The instant tenderness of eyes,
With Lensky unexpected friction,
With Olga strange behave, besides,
By all what happened she is puzzled.
She is disturbed, her soul is troubled
By jealous anguish and depression.
It looks like someone’s hand compression
Squeezes her heart and does remind
A chasm, which is so dark and sad...
“I’ll perish”, Tanya faintly said,
“But perish from him I won’t mind.
He can’t make happy me, that’s why
I shouldn’t murmur, why should I?”

IV

Full speed ahead, ahead my story!
I should new character conceive...
Five miles away from Krasnogorie
(The Lensky’s village) used to live,
And does it well till nowadays
In philosophic desert place,
Zaretsky, sometimes hooligan,
The gambling gangsters ataman,
Scapegraces‘ head, tribune of taverns,
But now a kind easy man,
Paterfamilias (single), then,
Trustworthy friend, landowner sound,
And I should add an honest man...
That’s how the century does mend!

V

Some years ago in high society
His evil courage brought him fame,
Since shooting ace from gun he lightly
Did strike a bullet in the aim.
And more than that, once in a battle
He tried in rush with foe to settle,
Excelled and straight into the mud
Fell from a horse, since was dead drunk;
And by the Frenchmen being captured
(It was a valuable bail!)
Like Roman hero did unveil
His courage ready to be tortured.
Thus, every evening at Very
He drained the bottles, two or three.

VI

He used sometimes to ridicule
And pool the wool over the eyes,
Of a smart man could make a fool
Doing it straight or otherwise.
Though, like all other spiteful jesters,
He learned sometimes the bitter lessons,
It happened, he got trapped as well,
And like a simpleton he fell.
He could be funny, cheer by quarrel,
Could respond keenly or look dull,
Could hold his tongue or make it fun,
Sometimes, the common sense could follow,
Could cause to quarrel the young men,
To duel barrier bring them, then,

VII

To reconcile them, then for triple
To organize a friendly lunch,
And after that defame in secret
By the light jest or other lies.
Sed alia tempora! Thus, boldness
(Like dream of love or other nonsense)
With the young years is slipping by
And my Zaretsky that is why
From storms escaped now lives in peace
The life of real ancient sage,
And covered by acacia shades,
Seeds cabbage like Horace in Greece,
And breeding ducks and geese at that
Teaches to kids the alphabet.

VIII

He was not dumb, that’s why Onegin,
Though didn’t perceive his talents well,
Esteemed his spirit, also valued
His sound talk of this of them.
Onegin met him, and not once
Was pleased to talk with him and, thus,
Was not at all this time surprised,
When saw him coming with sunrise.
Zaretsky after the first greeting
The conversation briefly ended,
Then, archly smiled, his hand extended
With a note by the poet written.
Onegin came to window and
The letter silently had scanned.

IX

It was a noble, even pleasant
What they were used to call cartel,
Politely, like a chilly pedant,
Lensky sent challenge to his pal.
Onegin with no extra motions,
Without questions or emotions
And with no words unnecessary
Said briefly that he’s always ready.
Zaretsky didn’t need explanations,
To stay for long he did not will,
And having lots of things to deal
Had left with no clarifications.
But with his soul at tete-a-tete
Onegin didn’t like all of that.

X

It serves me right, he thought when judging
Himself at conscience secret court,
His own behavior criticizing
Excuse for what he’d done he sought;
How could he play this spiteful trick
And make the bashful soul so sick!
And why to play in love should not
A poet who’s eighteen years old?
It is excusable. Eugene,
Who loved the youth by all his soul,
Should at that time his person show
Not as a bigot, but be keen
As real sage and noble man,
Whose mind is above fake shame.

XI

He should nobility uncover
Instead of bristling up like beast;
He should disarm the younger brother,
Calm down burning heart at least.
“But now too late, the time flew by...
Besides, this old duelist guy
Has interfered; and he is mean,
A scandalmonger, that’s the deal...
Of course, his words should cause despise,
They are just stupid, nothing more,
But whisper and the fools’ guffaw...
To lose your face - that is the price...”
We can’t ignore the public spirit,
On which the modern world is spinning!

XII

With enmity the poet seethes
At home awaiting for response,
But now, the pompous neighbor brings
A formal answer... yes, of course.
The jealous man can celebrate,
Since all that time he was afraid
That the arch person will somehow
Laugh off and thus escape, but now
He has no chance for duel skipping,
All settled. Thus a plan they make...
Tomorrow morning at daybreak
At the old mill to have a meeting,
They’ll cock the pistols, after that
Will aim each other’s thigh or head.

XIII

And Lensky in his mind seething
Decided to despise the flirt,
Ignore her before fatal meeting.
He watched the sun, the clock. And what?
Threw it away, and after all
Found himself at neighbors’ home.
He thought that Olga would be troubled
And by his visit would be puzzled.
But he was wrong... as always merry
Like nothing bad she ever did,
She sprang from porch the guest to greet
Being like flighty hope, like fairy,
So lively, cheerful and carefree,
As in the past she used to be.

XIV

“Why yesterday you’d vanished early?”
That’s what she asked the guest at first.
The question made Vladimir sorry,
He could not give a right response.
And under her angelic stare
All his resentment flew away,
How could he innocence withstand,
This lively soul misunderstand?
He looks at her in sweet oblivion
And thinks that he is beloved still,
Repentance brings his soul to thrill,
He wants show mercy, he’s obedient,
He trembles, cannot find words,
He is just happy, no more odds...

XV XVI XVII

But, then, again reflective, gloomy
In front of Olga, nice and fair,
Vladimir was not able, truly,
To speak about yesterday.
“I'll save her from the evil torture,
I won’t let terrible debaucher
Seductive talent exercise
And virgins catch by praise and sighs;
I won’t let toxic worm to gnaw
The morning lily blossom’s stem,
I won’t let flower to wane,
When it’s best time for it to grow”.
So far as I can understand,
He’s shooting with his former friend.

XVIII

If he could at that time compare
His wound with my Tatiana’s sorrow!
Would ever she had been aware
Of what he’s planning for tomorrow,
That Lensky sent Onegin challenge,
And both of them were close to perish!
Ah, maybe then her love and pain
Would make them bosom friends again!
Nobody at that time discovered
This unexpected passion, yet,
In secret Tanya pined of that,
Onegin was as always silent;
Tatiana’s nanny was aware,
But was not smart enough to care.

XIX

Vladimir was in absent mind,
Now taciturn, then, gay again,
Since poets by their Muse inspired
Are all like that, and he’s the same;
He frowned, tried to play clavichord,
But managed only one accord,
Then cast at Olga vivid eyes
And faintly whispered... isn’t it nice?
But it was late and time for leaving;
And bidding farewell to the girl
He felt the trouble overall,
His heart was close to tear in grieving.
She glanced at him. “What’s going on?”
He answered - Nothing. - And was gone.

XX

When being home, he checked the pistols,
Then put them back into the case.
He took off dress and with persistence,
By grievous premonitions chased,
Tried to read Schiller, yet, in vain,
He failed to turn sad thoughts away...
Just Olga occupied his soul,
Her view disturbed him more and more.
Vladimir closes Schiller’s book
And takes a pen to write the verses,
The rhymes are full of loving nonsense,
They ring and pour at the lone nook.
He recites them in sweet oblivion,
Like drunken Delvig in delirium.

XXI

By chance I have retained these verses
And can recite them, here are they...
“Where are the days of my life blossom?
The golden youth has passed away!
What’s planning to me coming morning?
My gaze in vain attempts foreknowing.
It’s hidden in the obscure haze.
The fortune law is always sage.
Should I fall down punched with arrow,
Or flying by it will pass me?
All deeds are blessing, let it be,
The day and night, delight and sorrow
Change one another... it’s the law
That darkness obscures bright day glow.

XXII

A, morning beam will flash tomorrow
A vivid day will start to play.
And I, maybe, by sad doom followed
Shall fall into the beyond stay.
And all, what of me can remind,
Will be erased from human’s mind.
But you, the beauty all above,
Would you, sometimes, esteem my love?
Would you pour tears, and think of me,
And whisper visiting my urn...
He’d perished at the early dawn,
And all his youth he hallowed me!
My cordial friend, my beloved wife,
Please come to me and share my life!..”

XXIII

That’s how he wrote, inertly, gloomy,
(And we call this romanticism?
I do not see here any, truly,
Though, I am far from criticism.)
But finally, before sunrising
He stopped his talent exercising,
And searching for a rhyme in verse
He’d fallen into half a drowse;
But just he fell into oblivion
And by Morpheus was embraced
And by alarming dreaming chased,
Here is this scandalmongers’ minion...
“It’s over six and time to go,
Onegin should not wait for long”.

XXIV

But he was wrong... that time Onegin
At home was sleeping like a log.
The night time shades have started fading,
And Vesper is hailed by a cock.
But he is sleeping and doesn’t care.
The sun is rising over there,
And snow is whirled by sudden blow,
It spins and shines, the day starts glow.
He stays in bed and does not mind
Watching a dream, he’s in a drowse,
But finally he is aroused
And leaves the bed, raises the blinds.
He looks and sees, that long ago
He should leave home and now must go.

XXV

He rings a bell; here is his servant -
Frenchman Gilliotte is coming in,
He brings the dressing gown, and toilet,
And bedroom shoes, and serves to him.
In rush Onegin dresses up
And asks the servant to catch up,
A case with pistols to prepare
And of the duel be aware.
A racing sleigh waits at the entrance,
He gets on, and they start the ride
And shortly to the mill arrived.
He gives to servant the directions...
To bring the barrels and besides,
To move the horses to safe site.

XXVI

Was waiting there for a long time.
Zaretsky, rural engineer,
Was criticizing mill design.
"What’s going on, and where is that,
Who’ll be your second?” - neighbor said.
He was the duels doctrinaire
And loved to follow the rules strictly.
A duel must by just and fair,
A person should be slain with care
According to the rules and neatly,
Just like the olds established that
(For this he earns my compliment).

XXVII

“Here is my second - Eugene said. -
I can’t foresee any objection,
Monsieur Guillot is my best friend,
You cannot claim any rejection;
And though he is unknown to you
He’s honest fellow, that’s for sure”.
Zaretsky held his scathing tongue
And had accepted that demand.
“Well, shall we start?” - applied Onegin.
- I think, we shall, - Vladimir said.
They to the mill their steps direct.
Zaretsky and the honest fellow
Have settled an important deal.
Have dropped the eyes, the foes stand still.

XXVIII

Are they the foes?! For how long they
Thirst for the blood and are in quarrel?
How long ago they used to share
Their pastime, meals, plans for tomorrow?
The former friends are full of bile,
As pushed by the ancestral rite,
Like in a bad and obscure dream
They stay in front in calm and dim
Preparing perish to each other.
But should not they just start to laugh
Before a hand is stained with blood?
Shouldn’t they try peace way to discover?
But enmity in high-society
Is always by false shame excited.

XXIX

The pistols sparkled at a distance,
A hammer at a ramrod nocks,
The bullets sink in tubes of pistols,
And for the first time clicks a cock.
Gunpowder leaves a greyish track,
When being poured on pistol’s rack.
The well-fixed flints are cocked upright;
Guillot drew back to a safe site
(He looks upset and pretty harassed).
They throw the cloaks to free the hands,
Thirty two steps Zaretsky spans;
He’s strict and not at all embarrassed.
He draw the friends to the last step
And they take pistols after that.

XXX

“That’s it, now go”. And in cold mind
Not aiming one another, yet,
They started to approach in quiet
By steady, firm and sound gait.
They made the first four dreadful stairs,
Onegin was the first to raise
His pistol slowly on the walk
And pressed his finger to the cock.
When five more steps they both had made,
Vladimir screwing up left eye
Began to aim, but at that time
Onegin shot... The clock of fate
Has chimed for Lensky by grave sound.
He drops the pistol on the ground,

XXXI

Then puts his hand on chest and slowly
Falls on the snow. His hazy eyes
Not torture show, by death are glowing.
It’s like a mass of snow and ice
With sparkles at the bright sun shining
From a hill’s slope is slowly sliding.
With icy cold instantly poured,
To Lensky Eugene quickly moved.
He looks at him and calls... It’s awesome...
He’s perished. The young poet’s fate
Has turned to the untimely death!
A storm did breathe, the charming blossom
Has faded at the early dawn,
The altar’s sacred flame has gone!

XXXII

He lies immovable, his brow
Looks very languishing and weird.
The bullet went through chest and now
The blood from smoking wound does bleed.
And just an instant far ago
The poet’s soul was still aglow
With enmity, and hope, and love,
The life was sparkling stirring blood.
Like a deserted home remains
Without noise, without light,
In silence all the day and night.
The shutters locked, the window panes
Are whitewashed, there is no more host.
Where is he? God knows. He is lost.

XXXIII

It's nice to rage embarrassed foe
By bold and biting epigram;
It’s nice to see that he doesn’t more
Intend to play or to make fun,
Declines his horns and sees his face,
But to admit it feels disgrace.
It’s nice, my friend, when you can see
How he, like foolish, cries... it’s me!
And even nicer with persistence
To plan to him untimely death
And aim at his pallid forehead
At nobly measured sound distance;
Yet, to make him a really dead
You scarcely would be too much glad.

XXXIV

What will you feel, when it was you
Who’ve shot a young and pleasant pal,
Who by response, immodest view
Or any other bagatelle
Insulted you over a bottle
Or being by a nuisance throttled
Proudly challenged you to fight?
Would ever you feel satisfied
And would be glad to see a body,
Which lies immovable on earth?
On fading brow you see the death,
It stiffens, ossifies; nobody
Replies to your hopeless request,
He’s deaf and mute, and nothing else.

XXXV

Thus, tortured by the conscience pangs,
The pistol squeezing in his hand,
At Lensky stricken Eugene stares.
“That’s that, he’s killed”, - the neighbor said.
He’s killed! This dreadful exclamation
Produced in Eugene bad vibration.
He steps aside, for people calls.
Zaretsky Lensky’s body rolls
Into his cloak, like dreadful treasure,
Puts on a sleigh the frozen corps.
The horse when feeling dead man snorts,
Drops lather, thrashes like in seizure,
The iron bits makes wet and bites,
And like a flying arrow rides.

XXXVI

Yes, for the poet you feel sorry...
In blossom of the cheerful hopes
He hasn’t fulfill his dream of glory,
Just getting rid of swaddling clothes.
He’s faded! Where’s his excitation,
Romantic noble aspiration,
And thoughts and feelings of young man,
High, lofty, tender, daring, fair?
Where are the stormy amorous passions,
And thirst for knowledge and for work,
And shame of vice and other fault,
And cherished hopes, and bright impressions,
Unearthly dreams, and sweet delusions,
And sacred poetry’s illusions?

XXXVII

But, maybe, for the world’s well-being,
At least, for fame he was conceived;
His silenced lyre if not stopped singing
Could be high valued and esteemed,
And glory him in future ages;
And, maybe, on the public stages
He could achieve a supreme grade.
And, maybe, his unhappy shade
Has hidden entity, when leaving,
Which makes a mystery to us,
Life-giving voice has died, alas;
Beyond the threshold of the being
The anthem of the future tribes
Will never mention it sometimes.

XXVIII XXXIX

Though, also different could happen,
A common fate could await him,
The poet’s talent could die latent
Or with the years would just get dim.
In many aspects he would vary,
He would leave muses and get married.
In quilted robe the rest of life
Would be a cuckold at his wife.
He’d learn what human life is really,
In forty would fall ill with gout,
He’d eat, drink, bore, decay, grow stout,
And finally in bed while dreaming
Would die in peace among his kids,
The whining skirts and healing prigs.

XL

No matter what could be, my reader,
Alas, but the young paramour,
Romantic pal and pensive dreamer
Is killed by friendly hand, for sure!
There is a place nearby to mansion,
Where dwelled the kid of inspiration...
Two pines by roots together merge,
A brook meandering there flows
Emerging from a nearby valley.
It is a place for ploughmen’s rest,
Where reapers use to play and jest
And dip the jugs, where pipe is playing.
There, at the brook in shade of limes
Today a simple gravestone lies.

XLI

Just here (when on the shoots of fields
Begins to drip refreshing rain),
A shepherd weaving bast shoe sings
A song of Volga’s fishermen.
And a young lady - city dweller,
Who to the country likes to travel,
When rides headlong in fields alone
Uses to stop at the gravestone.
She stops the horse by the reins drawing.
There is inscription on the stone,
It is what she is looking on.
Her reading fluent eyes are fogging.
She’s reading epitaph, at that
Her tender eyes are getting wet.

XLII

Being immersed into the dreaming
She slowly rides by open fields.
The Lensky’s fate against the willing
For long disturbs her thoughts and feels.
She thinks... “What is now Olga doing?
And wasn’t she by this trouble ruined
Or didn’t grieve much and stopped to pine?
And where’s her sister passing time?
And where is this ambiguous figure,
The trendy foe of trendy belles,
And where today this glum crank stays,
The killer of the youthful singer?”
Sometimes I’ll finish my true tale
And then report you in detail,

XLIII

But not today, though, I sincerely
Do love the hero of my tale,
And shall return to him, believe me,
But now not that disturbs my brain.
The years to severe prose incline,
The years the playful rhyme decline,
And I (confessing with a sigh)
Follow my muse with less excite.
My pen has no more inclination
To stain the flighty paper leaves,
The other, cold prosaic dreams,
The other stern considerations
In the high life’s stir and in calm
Disturb a dream of my soul now.

XLIV

I’ve learned the voice of new desires,
And the new sorrow learned for real,
But for the former - hope expires,
The olden sorrow stirs me still.
Where is the pleasure of my dreams,
Which should be rhymed with youth extremes?
I won't believe, but is at last
The wreath of youth has drooped, alas?
I won’t believe, but is it real,
Without elegiac plays,
That spring of my galloping days
(What I for fun used to reveal)
Will never come again, has gone,
My thirtieth birthday coming on!

XLV

Thus, my midday has come and I
Cannot deny it... yes, it has.
But that’s all right, I say good by
To my light-headed youthful days!
Thank you for pleasure and enjoyments,
For melancholy, lovely torments,
For stir, for tempests and for feasts,
For all, for all your pleasant gifts!
And I am thankful for enjoying
You, both, in disquiet and in quiet;
I have enjoyed, and that’s all right;
Enough! I am my soul employing
In search for other novel way,
To take a rest of former stay.

XLVI

Let me glance back. Farewell to places,
The thickets, where my days did flow,
Suffused with laziness and passions,
With dreams of my reflective soul.
But you, the youthful inspiration,
Remain and stir imagination,
The drowsy heart reanimate,
My lonely nook, please, animate,
Don’t let the poet’s soul to still,
To become hardened and to wane
And finally to live in vain
In high society’s fatal thrill.
This is a pool, my friends, where I
With you take bath and feel so fine!


Chapter VII

I
The snow has left the local highlands
And pepped up by the vernal beams
Has run onto the drowned flood lands
By cheery muddy water streams.
The nature with a smile arousing
Through dream is greeting the year dawning;
The shining sky is blue and clear,
The still bare forests start to green
Like by a down covered lightly.
A bee from waxen cell of hive
For tribute to the fields starts fly.
The valleys dry and blush up brightly.
The flocks make noise, a nightingale
At night starts singing in the dale.

II

How doleful looks to me appearing
Of sacred spring, the time for love!
And what a languishing blessed stirring
It rouses in my soul and blood!
What a sweet heartache I am feeling!
Spring resurrection causes thrilling
When it is blowing on my face
In solitude of rural space!
Is this delight to me uncommon,
And all what gladdens and gives light,
What looks excited and shines bright
Produces languishing and boredom?
And can it be that my soul died,
And spring doesn’t please it, doesn’t excite?

III

Am I not glad to resurrection
Of perished in the autumn leaves
And can remain in sad distraction,
When hearing how a forest breathes?
Or with the nature animation
We do associate frustration
Caused by the years, which passed away
And never will be back again?
Or, maybe, in the mind dreaming,
In midst of the poetic drowse,
Another former spring arouse,
And it produces my heart thrilling
By vision of a nice far place,
The magic night and Luna’s face...

IV

It’s time for you, the idle creatures,
The epicurean-sage men,
Who by indifference are featured,
You, Levshin’s school of being fans,
And you, the countryside Priams,
And sentimental city dames,
The spring attracts to rural sites,
It’s time of warmth, of works, of sighs,
The time of joyful tempting revels,
Of the seductive springtime nights,
Souls’ inspirations and delights.
Ahead, ahead, arrange the travels
By long drive carriage or post-chaise,
Do drag away from city’s gates.

V

And you, my favorable reader,
Please leave the city’s restless site,
Where you spent time in winter season,
And hire a carriage for a drive.
You will be followed by my Muse
And will be by a grove amused
In the estate above a river,
In a nice nook, where my tale’s hero,
Like a sad hermit spent his time,
Where in an estate nearby
Tatiana lived - a naive dreamer.
Eugene now does not dwell there, yet...
The grievous traces he has left.

VI

Along a path in the groves’ shadow
Let us proceed to a small brook,
Which twists and runs on a green meadow
And makes a turn at a nice nook.
It is a place, where nightingale
Sings songs of love in a calm dale.
There you can hear the brook's sweet tone
And see a lonely sad gravestone,
Which’s covered by the old pines’ shadow.
A stranger reads inscription there...
“Vladimir Lensky rests in here,
A youthful poet and bold fellow
(The date reminds when he’d gone)
Please, stay in piece under the stone!”

VII

It happened that an early breeze
Swung a strange wreath above the urn;
It was hanged up on a pine tree
By caring hands of an unknown.
It happened in the late time evenings
Two maidens here were moved by feelings.
And at the grave in the moonlight
They sat embraced and sadly cried.
But nowadays, the sad gravestone
Is not more cared, the former path
Is close to lifeless, there’s no wreath;
Just the same shepherd sings a song.
He weaves a bast shoe; sick and frail,
He stays alone, his hair is gray.

VIII IX X

Oh, Vladimir! Not for long time
She bemoaned over you, alas!
The woe had passed, she stopped to pine
And did not die of grief at last.
The other drove her off distraction,
The other gained her heart’s affection,
By amour flatter conquered her;
An uhlan captured Olga’s soul.
An uhlan lulled her and quite shortly
He led her to the altar’s throne.
She shyly stands under a crown,
Her head is bowed, the eyes blink courtly,
The lips are adorned with a smile;
She feels quite happy, she is fine.

XI

Oh, Vladimir! In the beyond,
In deaf eternity remote
Did you emit a doleful moan
By this unfaithfulness been shocked?
Or being sank into oblivion
The poet sleeps and has no feeling,
And nothing can affect his sleep,
He sleeps in peace, he’s always meek.
Thus, people sink into oblivion
Just stepping over grave’s threshold.
The friends’ and enemies’ escort
Deceases suddenly, the minion
Is still of interest to those,
Who fight for heirloom, spite and curse.

XII

And shortly ringing voice of Olga
Fell silent in the Larins’ home.
The uhlan got an urgent order
And with the wife he had to go.
The mother suffered separation
And being close to hard frustration
Bitterly cried and could not stop.
But Tanya weep and cry could not,
A cloud of a deadly pallor
Had covered her uncheerful face,
When she was at the lobby stairs,
And people hustled in the parlor.
She came to the departing cab
And seeing them looked very sad.

XIII

For long, like through a misty cloud
She followed them by doleful gaze...
She is alone, no one around!
Alas! The friend for many days,
Her darling frisky young companion,
Her confidant and native fellow
By fate is taken far away,
And now they’ll separately stay.
She looks at the deserted garden
And strolls without purpose, sad...
No one can comfort her in that.
Misfortune came all of a sudden.
She cannot get relief and, thus,
Her heart is tearing into parts.

XIV

The solitude is so severe,
The passion flares and burns and pains,
The heart beats faster in a fever
And with Onegin still remains.
She will not see him never-ever,
She must detest him being clever
As brother’s killer, that is why
She mustn't miss him; but, same time...
The poet now is dead, his bride
Belongs to other one and no one
Still thinks of him. The page’s turned over,
The poet’s spirit has expired.
Two hearts, maybe, till recent day
Still feel deep sorrow... But should they?

XV

It’s getting dark. The sky stopped shining.
A beetle buzzed. A brook streamed quiet.
The round dances were expiring.
The fishers kindled smoking fire.
The wind calmed down in the field.
The pallid moon in sky appeared.
We see Tatiana on the road,
In dreams immersed, she walked for long.
She walked and walked, all of a sudden
She saw a mansion from a knoll,
A hamlet, grove and after all
Spread by the river uncared garden.
She looked at it, the unknown place
Stirred up her soul, her heart beat fast.

XVI

She’s in confusion... “Shall I see
His home and garden, or shall not.
He is not here, no one knows me
In the estate, and why should not?”
And being stirred by languish feeling
She looks around holding breathing,
And then with puzzle in her gaze
She enters the abandoned place.
The dogs attacked her barking loud.
She was afraid, and to her cry
The houseboys at once arrived.
They scuffled with the dogs and thundered,
And fighting pushed the dogs away,
And of the damsel took best care.

XVII

“Can you show me the landlord’s mansion?” -
Tatiana asked; the helpful boys
Ran to Anisiya with intention
To take the keys from entrance doors.
Anisiya instantly appears,
And opens entrance doors with keys.
Tatiana enters empty home,
Where my tale’s hero dwelled alone.
She looks around, in a parlor
A cue is resting on a pool,
A lash for riding on a stool
Being forgotten lonely lying.
Babushka says... ”Here’s a fireside,
Where master used to sit in quiet.

XVIII

In winter time, here, he shared table
With deceased Lensky - neighbor lord.
Please, follow me, give me a favor,
That is the master’s room and board,
Here, he ate coffee and reposed,
And listened to bailiff’s reports,
And in the morning read a book;
It was, as well, the old lord’s nook.
Sometimes on Sundays, wearing glasses,
Here, at the window on this stool,
He played with me the card game Fool.”
And she her former master blesses...
“God, let his bones to rest in peace,
And grant his soul salvation, please!”

XIX

Tatiana views all that with pleasure,
Her soul is moved, her eyes get wet;
Abandoned house looks like treasure,
It stirs her heart, she’s pleased by that.
She’s watching in a sweet distress
A darkened lamp, a desk for chess,
A heap of books, a lonely bed,
And over it a Scottish plaid;
The moon’s twilight is in the window
And obscured neighborhood landscape,
Lord Byron’s portrait hanging straight,
And on the right a puzzling figure -
An idol with the clinched crossed hands
With covered by hat dull brow stands.

XX

Tatiana charmed and fascinated
Stays in the stylish cell for long.
But it is late, the light has faded,
The wind starts blowing, it gets cold.
A grove above the river sleeps
The moon beyond the hill has ceased,
The night is falling, time to go,
The pilgrim should now leave back home.
And Tanya hiding agitation,
Yet, not without heave a sigh
Starts her way back in the moonlight.
But before gets an invitation
To visit this deserted dome,
To read here books and stay alone.

XXI

Thus, after farewell to the woman
Tatiana shortly left for home.
But in the next day’s early morning
She was again in the same dome,
And in the lonely silent study
Forgot of all the other worries.
And when at last she was alone,
She could not stand and wept for long.
Then, to the books she paid attention,
She did not notice them before,
And their selection puzzled her,
It was unusual strange collection.
And reading them, a word by word,
She had discovered a new world.

XXII

Onegin did not like much reading,
As we have mentioned at right place,
Yet, there were several proceedings,
Which he excluded from disgrace...
Gyaur’s and Juan’s composer, first,
Plus two-three other novels, most
Depicting modern world and style,
And how a human can survive,
To whom himself makes only treasure,
Who is immoral, selfish, cold,
Who is a dreamer in this world
And loves himself beyond all measure.
Whose spiteful mind is restless,
It always boils, but is useless.

XXIII

On many read by Tanya pages
There are sharp traces of the nails,
At these the intent damsel gazes,
Just that her mind instigates.
Tatiana is in trepidation,
The signs and marks cause rumination...
What caused him wondering and what
He used to highlight and denote?
And she examines with attention
By pencil scribbled words and signs.
All that his image purifies
And shows his real soul’s affection.
The short comments and marks reveal
Onegin’s mind and his feel.

XXIV

And my Tatiana, little by little,
Starts to perceive, thanks God for that,
The man, whom she adores so fatal,
For whom she pines, who makes her sad,
Who is destined to her by fortune...
Is he just odd and harmful person,
A Heaven’s creature, from the Hell
An evil fellow or good man?
And what is he? Is he just fiction,
A worthless phantom with pretense,
A Muscovite, who Harold feigns,
A foreign oddity affliction,
A fancy sayings’ lexicon,
Just parody and nothing more?

XXV

Has she interpreted this riddle?
Has she discovered the true word?
The clock is running, time for leaving,
She should depart from Eugene’s world.
She is returning home by walking,
Where she’s a subject of a talking.
- What shall I do with my Tatiana? -
With groan said the senile mother. -
How can I settle this tough matter?
It’s time to match the elder one,
What can I do, when everyone,
Who made proposal, was rejected...
Point-blank refuse. She always greaves,
And roams alone in woods in fields. -

XXVI

“Isn’t she in love?” - Who can it be?
Ruffianov wooed - reject, alas.
Then, Roosteroff - the same, you see.
Hussar Pykhtin had stayed at us;
How nice he was, how hardly trying,
How courteous and gratifying!
I guessed, perhaps, he’d make a deal.
Alas, again, and all stays still. -
“Good gracious, ma’am! I know way out -
To Moscow, to the fair of brides!
There is a lot of pleasant sites”.
- Oh, my old man, I am in doubt. -
“If you are in a shortage, then,
I can lend money to you, ma’am”.

XXVII

The old ma’am wisdom demonstrating
Approves this rational advice,
And after resource estimating,
The Moscow trip to winter times.
Tatiana hearing this idea
Feels quite a reasonable fear...
It’s always causes great anxiety
To demonstrate to high society,
To all these Circes and spoiled men,
The innocence of rural places,
The delayed speeches and same dresses,
And to provoke derisions then!
It’s fearful! To avoid the thrill
To stay in backwoods looks more real.

XXVIII

She gets up with a morning rise
And hurries to the groves and fields,
And by affected tender eyes
Glances around and, then, speaks...
“Farewell to you, the lovely dales
And woody knolls of native place,
And you, the forests I do love,
And beauty of the sky above,
Farewell to you the joyful nature,
I’m changing your enchanting light
To high life’s noise and vain delight.
Good bye my freedom, coming future
Is vague and obscure; where, what for
I have to go, who can it know?”

XXIX

Her summer walks are getting longer.
Sometimes, a knoll or a small brook
Amazes Tania like a wonder,
She stops for long and holds her look.
And with the groves and lovely vales
Like with her best and beloved friends
She hurries to communicate.
But summer comes to very late.
The golden autumn is arising.
The nature turns to pale and sad
Like offering prepared for death...
The northern wind the clouds driving;
It breathed and howled and here it is,
The magic winter makes us pleased.

XXX

It’s come and scattered, with white bunches
Has decorated knots of trees,
Has hanged on naked bushes’ branches,
By wavy carpets covered fields.
The river banks and river bed
Are leveled with a fluffy plaid.
The frost did sparkle. It is fine,
We greet the pranks of wintertime.
Just Tanya’s heart is in a worry...
She does not greet the winter more,
Doesn’t breathe the frost air as before,
Doesn’t use first snow from roof of banya
For washing shoulders, breast and face...
She hates to leave the native place.

XXXI

The term of leave for long expired,
The last departure day is close.
An old abandoned sleigh required,
Examined, fixed and cleaned from doze.
The string is usual... hooded carts
Drive tightly packaged bags and trunks
Full of the pans, and jugs, and chairs,
The mattresses, preserves in cans,
The feather beds, cocks in the cages,
The basins, pots, and all that stuff,
Which you will never have enough.
And finally they've packed the sledges
And bring eighteen old jades at last.
The maids start weeping, people fuss.

XXXII

They harness to the sleigh the horses.
The breakfast is already cooked.
The stuff is hilled, babushka crosses,
The peasants at the masters look.
An old postilion with a beard
Sits on a scraggy shaggy weed.
The servants gather at the doors
To say good by to their landlords.
They took a seat, the honored carriage
Is creeping sliding off the gate.
“Farewell to peaceable landscape!
Farewell to solitary refuge!
Should I see you again sometimes?..”
The tears do stream from Tanya’s eyes.

XXXIII

When the good willing education
Will be extended, thanks to that
With lapse of time (and calculation
Shows that this forecast is correct,
Five hundred years since now), maybe,
The roads in Russia, probably,
Will change completely and, in fact,
The endless country intersect.
Above the waters iron bridges
Will step erecting wide and high.
We’ll move the mountains and tie
The river beds and high top ridges.
The Christen world will then obtain
The inns for people entertain.

XXXIV

The roads are awful nowadays,
Neglected bridges are too bad,
Bed bugs and fleas at the road stays
Do not let travelers to nap;
There are no inns and catalogues
On walls of huts made of the logs
For nothing tease your appetite,
You can’t avoid a hungry night.
The countryside’s Cyclops, at that,
In front of slowly burning fires
By Russian hammers treat the tires
Of the neat items Europe made.
They bless the ruts of native land
And ditches of the Russian brand.

XXXV

But in the frosty winter time
A drive is effortless and easy.
The roads are flat like is a rhyme
Of senseless song, just little breezy.
Native automedons are perky,
The troika tireless, no jerky,
The milestones switch just one by one
That looks like fence while speedy run.
But Larina was dragging slowly,
To pay for post-chaise she didn’t want,
To use her private string preferred.
My heroine felt sick and lonely.
Thus, they reached Moscow seventh day,
And she was boring all the way.

XXXVI

Yes, they are close to destination,
The golden crosses shine on domes.
The heart is stirred in exaltation,
Here is the city of white-stones.
How pleased was I to see it, brothers,
When semicircles of the gardens,
The belfries, churches, booths and mansions
Appeared in front of me like phantoms!
How often in sad separation,
When I was staying far apart,
Oh, Moscow, you disturbed my heart!
Oh, Moscow, what a great affection
You really rouse in Russian soul!
How many feelings you do call!

XXXVII

The Peter’s Castle with its oaks
Appears in front. It looks so solemn.
It’s proud of the Russian folks...
In vain some time ago Napoleon
By the last fame intoxicated,
Just here, the Kremlin’s key awaited
Expecting to receive bow low;
Yet, Moscow said to him just “No!”,
And did not bring to him confession.
The Moscow Fire he received
Instead of feast, instead of gift
For the perfidious aggression.
From here Napoleon lost in thoughts
Watched how the flame old Moscow bursts.

XXXVIII

Good by, the faded glory’s witness,
The Peter’s Palace. Gee up, straight!
The posts show up white in a distance,
Now we are passing Tverskoy gate.
The sleigh speeds over the potholes,
Passes poor cabins, gardens, stores,
Street lampions, long skirts and boys,
Booths, peasants, sledges, city noise,
Huts, mansions, pharmacies, Cossacks,
Bukharians, boulevards and cloisters,
Cabmen with faces red like lobsters,
Side streets extending to the dark,
Lions on gates and on high domes
Flacks of jackdaws and grey-black crows.

XXXIX XL

This tiresome exhausting driving
Takes a full hour or more.
In a side street a stead is hiding,
Where at the courtyard’s entrance door
The sleigh now stops. They've come to stay
To the old aunt, who’s sick, but fair.
Three years she’s suffering consumption,
But still retains the sense and gumption.
In a torn caftan, wearing glasses,
Holding a sock, a gray Calmyk
Is meeting them. They hear a squeak
By stretched on sofa sick princess.
They start to hug, exchange the kisses
And tell how much each other misses.

XLI

“Pachette!” - Alina, dear Princess! -
“Who could imagine? Oh, my Lord!
How many days and years have passed?
Sit down, darling, it’s so odd!
It looks like novel’s scene, you know ...”
- Here is my elder, Tanya. -“Oh!
Tatiana, dear, come closer, please,
I think all that is in my dreams...
Do you remember Grandison?”
- What, Grandison? How great he was!
I can’t forget him, yes, of course! -
“He dwells not far, at Simeon;
This Eve he came to visit me.
His son just married." - I can see... -

XLII

“And also, yes, ... but let’s talk later.
Please, do not worry, in a day
Tatiana will be represented
To all her kin, though I should stay
At home, since barely drag my feet.
You are exhausted, let’s complete.
It’s time for all of us to rest.
I’m tired too. Oh, my poor chest!
Now even pleasure makes me tired,
Not only sadness... yes, my dear,
I am not good for any deal...
When you are old, life is so vile...”
She was entirely fatigued,
Began to cough and then to weep.

XLIII

Sick auntie’s cuddles and enjoyment
Affect Tatiana; yet, it’s quite
A problematic entertainment
Not in your room to spend a night.
And covered by the silky veils
In a new bed to sleep she fails,
A neighbor belfry’s early toll
(Forerunner of the morning toil)
Rises her up, calls to a window.
Tatiana looks at outdoor
The dusk thins out, but no more
She can see neither wood, nor meadow.
There’s unknown yard in front of her,
A stall, a fence and nothing more.

XLIV

And, thus, Tatiana everyday
Goes visit all her kindred’s dinners
To all her folks to demonstrate
Her absent-minded passiveness.
The relatives from far away
Are always welcomed with much care
By exclamations, bread and salt...
“You’ve grown up, Tanya! But, how odd!
I hold you on my hands, sometimes!
I used to feed you with the cakes!
I pulled your ears for childish pranks!
I retain how you were baptized!”
In chorus all the grannies say...
“How fast the years do fly away!”

XLV

But you don’t see in them the changes,
They are old fashioned specimens.
Thus, aunty Helen’s hat with laces
Is just the same for many years.
Lukeria L’vovna whitens face,
Lyubov Petrovna compliments,
Ivan Petrovich - greedy man,
Semen Petrovich - fool, as well,
And Pelageya Pantelevna
Has same boyfriend Monsieur Lepage,
And the same spitz and the same spouse,
The latter is the same club’s member,
He’s same way meek and deaf same way,
As always eats and drinks all day.

XLVI

Their daughters hug Tatiana fondly.
The Moscow youthful Graces, first,
Look at her silently and coldly,
Examine her from top to toes;
Besides they find that she’s weird,
Mincing, provincial, unclear,
And also skinny and too pale,
Though, still attractive and quite fair.
But then, obedient to the nature,
Make friends with her, invite to date,
Give kisses, touch the arms and prate,
Fluff up the curls and behave gracious,
Confide to her the private things,
The maidens’ secrets and the thinks

XLVII

Of their and other’s amour conquests,
Of hopes and pranks and pleasant dreams.
The naive talks and other nonsense
Pour on like rain and never cease.
Then, they require her confession
That should repay their declaration
And make the friendship sweet and meek.
But Tanya feels like in a sleep.
With no concern she hears their speeches,
Doesn’t understand, what do they chat,
Doesn’t want to share her secrets, yet,
And to expose to them the features
Of her beloved, and that is why
She's keeping silent all the time.

XLVIII

Tatiana tries to analyze
The conversations and the talks;
They in the parlor exercise
Such rambling, banal dialogs.
The atmosphere is languid, pale,
Even the slander is the same.
And in the speeches’ uselessness,
News, gossips, questions and requests
You’ll never hear for a full day
A clear, sensible idea,
Which touches languid heart for real,
Neither by chance, nor other way.
Even a nonsense, which is droll,
You’ll never meet in this void world.

XLIX

The gilded youth by a thick crowd
Casts at Tatiana a stiff gaze,
Talk over her between each other
Showing the ill-disposed disgrace.
Someone, who looks like wistful jester,
When viewing her goes into raptures,
And standing leaning on a door
An elegy prepares to her.
One day, when visiting his aunty,
Vyazemsky at her took a seat,
To entertain her did succeed.
And an old man, who saw him chatting,
Enquired gently, who is that,
And the old fashioned wig did set.

L

But there, where stormy Melpomen
Utters the long-drawn-out wails
(To please the women and the men
By waving tawdry gown she fails),
Where Thalia has lightly dozed,
Since does not hear the fans’ applauds,
And Terpsichore is only one,
Who marvels viewers, mostly young
(It also happened in past years,
When used to live and I, and you),
Nobody noticed her or viewed.
Neither lorgnettes of jealous dames,
Nor tubes of fancy connoisseurs
Did turn to her from armchair rows.

LI

They bring her to a public meeting.
It's cram, excitement and ardor,
The music play, the candles blinking,
The dancing couples flood the floor.
The beauties in light gowns attired,
The people’s crowd never tired,
A circle of the future brides -
All causes rapture and surprise.
It is a place where beaus show fashions,
Present their insolence and vests,
And absent-minded lorgnettes.
Hussars come here to spend vacations,
They rush to sparkle and to mate,
To thunder, capture and escape.

LII

There’re many bright stars in the night,
In Moscow many beauties shine.
But there’s no star, which is more bright
Than Moon prevailing in the sky.
But she, whom my poetic lyre
Doesn’t dare to trouble by a rhyme,
Among the ladies and the girls
Like Moon her beauty does expose.
What haven’s pride she’s demonstrating,
When touches by her feet the earth!
What bliss her breast is breathing off!
Her look is languishing and blessing!
But that’s enough, enough, I say...
You’ve paid for recklessness quite fair.

LIII

Noise, laughter, bustle, bows and greetings,
Gallop, mazurka, waltz, they dance.
Tatiana is unnoticed sitting
At a side column with two aunts.
She looks at all this fancy chick,
The high society makes her sick,
She’s suffocating... in her dreams
She streams back home to woods and fields,
The countryside and its poor dwellers,
And solitude of the nice nook,
Where flows her native lovely brook,
Back to the blossoms, novels’ heroes,
Dusk of the alleys of old limes,
Where he appeared to her sometimes.

LIV

Her thoughts are roaming far away,
She has forgotten noisy ball,
But a grand general right there
Is watching her across the hall.
The aunties noticed this straight glance
And pushed Tatiana both at once,
And whispered both to her at that...
- Look quickly, darling, to the left. -
“Left? Where is it? What’s going on?”
- It does not matter, turn your head...
Just over there, where people stand,
There are two men in uniform...
He stepped aside... and now sideways...
“This stout general, you say?”

LV

I offer my congratulation
And leave Tatiana for a while,
It’s time to change my tale direction
Not to forget of whom I rhyme...
And by the way, two words in an add-on...
I glory here my youthful fellow
And all his oddities, that’s why,
Please, bless the job I do long time,
You, epic Muse I am admiring!
And hand to me a rightful staff,
Not to be lost at a wrong path.
Enough, no bonds and no more tiring!
I’ve honored classicism, and thus,
Though late, prelude is done at last.


Chapter VIII

I

It was in Lycee’s lovely alleys,
Where I serenely bloomed in peace,
When I was fond of Apuleius
By reading Cicero displeased.
In spring, on Orphic mystic meadows,
Where swans were calling in the valleys,
Where in the calm the waters shined
Poetic Muse to me arrived.
Enchanting Muse illuminated
My student’s cell at that nice place,
And elegized the child’s plays,
The youthful sprees initiated,
She glorified my hearth and home
And tender dreams in flaming soul.

II

The world received her with a smile;
The first success encouraged me;
There, old Derzhavin had inspired
And blessed me stepping to the bier.

III

And thus, the tyranny of passions
Replaced to me the law and rules,
And I complied with crowd’s fashions
And drew my lively frisky Muse
To noisy feasts and raving clamors,
And thunderstorms of midnight revels.
To all these reckless crazy feasts
She used to bring her magic gifts,
And to me like Bacchante facing
Empting a cup she song to guests,
Young generation of the past
Was after her like crazy chasing.
It made me proud to amaze
My friends by lassie in those days.

IV

When I forsook their young communion
And ran away, I was pursued.
I’d formed with tender Muse a union
And all the way she wasn’t mute,
But pleased me by the magic tales,
On the Caucasian winding trails
Like Lenora with me did speed,
When moon was following the steed!
How often on Taurida’s shores
She led me in the dusk of night
To watch the murmur of seaside,
Nereids’ unceasing tender songs,
Eternal deep chorus of waves,
The anthem, which the Lord does praise.

V

She had forgotten bliss and brilliance
Of feasts in capital’s remote,
In meek Moldova’s wilds and forests
In the beyond of civil world
She used to visit nomads’ dwellings,
Tabernacles of the barbarians,
And had forgotten the Gods’ speech,
And to a scanty language switched
To sing the steppe that she was praising.
But suddenly all that has changed
And in my garden now she stands,
A country maiden I am gazing.
With grief and sorrow in her eyes
She hands a book in French and sighs.

VI

Now, I feel mounting excitement,
Since for the first time introduce
My beloved Muse to high society,
And thus, feel jealous and confused.
She’s sliding through a shining crowd
Of diplomats, who look so proud,
Aristocrats and army dandies
And all these fancy looking ladies.
And she admires all this chaos,
Flashing of speeches, ladies’ dress,
Welcoming of the coming guests
By a young lady of the house,
Like at a picture standing men,
Who for the ladies make a frame.

VII

She’s pleased by oligarchic manners
And proud coldness in the air,
And how the high society gathers -
A mixture of the ranks and years.
But who is there in elite crowd,
Stands mute and vague in live surround,
He looks like stranger at this place,
And watches people with stern face
Respecting them as boring medley?
What can you read on his pale face?
What is he doing at this place?
And who is he? Is it Onegin?
Oh! Can it happen? Yes, may be!
- How long ago he was dropped here?

VIII

IIs he the same or pacified?
Or is still posing as oddball?
What is he after self-exile?
And what so far he will prefer?
What will he demonstrate today,
And whom this time he’ll try to feign?
Harold, or Quaker, or Melmoth,
Cosmopolite or patriot?
Or he is now just decent fellow,
Like you and I is fair and nice?
At least, remember my advice...
The decayed fashion do not follow.
For long he used to fool the world...
- Are you acquainted? - Yes and not.

IX

- But why are you so negative,
When estimating my old friend?
Maybe, you just can not perceive
His merits and don’t understand
That carelessness of ardent natures
For those, who are worthless and selfish,
Looks like offense, or fun, or lies,
And loving scope the mind ties,
And very often idle speeches
We’re glad to take as real deeds,
That foolishness a harm conceives,
That big wigs value absurd features,
Just mediocrity we praise,
Don’t blame and do not find strange!

X

Blessed is the one, who’s young from youth,
Blessed is the one, who’s on time matured,
Who cold of being endured smooth
And did not rush against the nature.
Who never trusted to odd fables,
Didn’t keep away from high life’s rabbles,
Who was in twenty fop or bold,
In thirty matched like found gold;
Who being fifty was released
From private and all other debts,
Who all his glory, cash and ranks
Obtained in turn without fierce,
Of whom a hundred years they talk...
N.N. makes pride of all his folk.

XI

It’s sad to think that just for nothing
You've spent the treasure of young days,
That you’ve betrayed the youth and something
You’ll never do, it’s passed away;
That all the best expected deeds
Came true just only in your dreams,
You’ll never have a chance again;
The reveries like leaves decay.
It is unbearable to find
Just chain of meals in front of you,
Look at the life as at a queue
And following a solemn crowd
To realize that you do not
Share public’s passions and its thoughts.

XII

It is unbearable, I say,
Be reputed as feigned eccentric
Among the people who are fair,
To pass for sorrowful odd fellow
Or even Demon, whom I fame.
I’ll show Onegin now again.
Has killed his fellow at a duel,
Has lived till twenty six years old
Without purpose, with no job,
For nothing killing time as usual,
Without wife, by spleen entailed
To occupy himself he’d failed.

XIII

And he was seized by a displeasure,
By wish to switch to other sites
(Not for too many it makes pleasure
To overcome the ills and ties).
Thus, he had left his country dwelling,
The fields and woods secluded staying,
The places, where the bloody shade
Disturbed him giving no escape.
And started like a pilgrim roaming
Complied with feelings, purposeless,
But shortly changing of a place
Like all the other things turned boring;
He returned back and after all
Like Chatsky got from ship to ball.

XIV

But something happened in the chaos,
A whisper spread in the state hall...
It's to the lady of the house
A dame is coming, not alone,
A general makes her escort.
She’s not loquacious and not cold,
Her look is always calm and fair,
Success is not her major gain,
Without all that bagatelle,
Doesn’t try to imitate somebody,
Looks like a quiet, easy body,
The Frenchmen probably would say
Du comme il faut... (Shishkov, no odds,
I can’t select the Russian words).

XV

The ladies started to move forward,
The old ones could not hold the smiles,
The gentlemen bowed a bit lower
And tried to catch her tender eyes;
The damsels tried to look more shy,
When they were strolling nearby,
A general, who came with her,
Showed pride and drew up best of all.
No one would say that she is splendid,
But neither you, nor friends of yours,
When viewing her from top to toes,
Could ever say, when being candid,
That she, how we from London learn,
Is vulgar (Can’t find other term...

XVI

I love so much this English word,
But do not know how to translate,
It is quite new in Russian world
And scarcely will deserve high rate.
In epigram it would work, maybe ...)
But I return to my fair lady.
Looking light-hearted, nice and sweet
She at the table took a sit
With Nina Vronsky, who, you see,
Is Neva’s famous Cleopatra,
Who radiates the bliss, etcet(e)ra,
But at same time, you should agree,
Despite of all her marble splendor
Could not eclipse her modest neighbor.

XVII

“It cannot be, - reflects Onegin, -
Can she be here? Oh, yes ... But, no...
From thickets and the backwoods’ cabins..."
And he directs lorgnette to her.
But cannot get a clear answer,
And in his mind he is transferred
To what had happened far ago.
“My prince, please tell me, do you know,
Who is it, in a crimson hat,
With Spain Ambassador now talking?”
The prince replied with Eugene walking...
- You have not been presented, yet?
For long you’ve slighted the high life! -
“But who is she?” - She is my wife. -

XVIII

“So, you are married! I can see!
And how for long?” - Soon for two years. -
“And who is she?” She’s Larins, nee. -
“Tatiana!” - Do you know her? - “Yes,
She was my neighbor”. - Then, let’s go. -
Prince brings Onegin close to her,
And then presents his friend and kin.
Tatiana casts a glance at him...
Yes, she was puzzled by the meeting,
No doubt, it disturbed her soul,
But no confusion she did show
Though wasn’t prepared to Eugene’s greeting...
She had retained her look and tone,
Her bow was calm and voice was low.

XIX

She did not show just any fever,
Her face didn’t neither blush nor pale...
She did not move a muscle, even
Did not compress her lips, I swear!
Onegin searched in great impatience
For past naive Tatiana’s traces,
But just no features have retained.
He tried to talk, but could not say
Even few words. Though, she inquired,
How long he’s here and where’s he from,
Isn’t he from backwoods so well known?
And after that her look turned tired,
And with her husband she slipped off...
Onegin stayed upset and shocked.

XX

Is she that one Tatiana, really,
From god forsaken far remote
(Of whom I told in the beginning),
Who to him sometimes wrote a note;
By good intention being driven,
He gave her lesson in the garden,
The one, whose letter he still keeps,
Where every line with ardor speaks,
Who was so frank, whose soul was burning;
Is she that girl ... or it’s a dream?
This girl, who didn’t stir any thrill,
Whose feeling he was just ignoring;
And isn't this lady he just saw
A bashful girl he used to know?

XXI

He's leaving the cramped public meeting
And drives back home to go to bed;
There, in a late sleep he is seeing
A dream now pleasing and now sad.
When waking up, he gets a letter
From prince NN. What is the matter?
Invites to visit him tonight.
My God! I’ll see her, yes, all right!
He writes response polite and pleasing.
What’s going on? Is it a dream!
And something stirred inside of him,
His lazy soul is moved by feeling...
What is it, vanity or else?
It’s youthful trouble - love (I guess)!

XXII

Again Onegin shows impatience
And counts hours again.
But it chimes ten and to the entrance
He gets as soon as only can.
He comes inside with trepidation;
Princess is single in the mansion.
They sit together for a while,
But the right words he cannot find.
Onegin looks inept and gloomy,
He hardly gives the right response;
His head is full of stubborn thoughts;
His gaze is stubborn, he has truly
Forgotten words; and at same time
Tatiana looks quite free and fine.

XXIII

The husband enters terminating
This so upsetting private stay,
Starts with Onegin recollecting
The former years’ mischief and play.
They start to laugh. The guests arrived.
With a coarse salt of public spite
They animated conversation
And stirred the common agitation.
In front of hostess light talks flitting
Was interrupted time to time
By wise discussions of past time
With no coarse subjects or nitpicking.
And fluid vividness of these
Didn’t scare at all nobodies’ ears.

XXIV

Here was metropolis’s cream,
The elite and the fashion models,
Those, who get overall esteem,
And always necessary clowns;
Here were old ladies in a drowse,
In caps and roses, ill-disposed;
The damsels standing at the wall,
The persons, who don’t smile at all;
Here was an envoy, who debated
Political and state affairs;
A fragrant old man with gray hair,
Whose jokes were so much outdated
That despite all his witty wise
He looked ridiculous sometimes.

XXV

Here was an angry gentleman,
Who was to epigrams so greedy
That scoffed at sisters’ monogram,
At oversweeten tea and sweetie,
At flatness of the femme du monde,
At high society men’s wrong tone,
At lies of magazines, at war,
At obscure novel and so on.

XXVI

Here was Prolasov, who had gotten
His fame by meanness of his soul,
Thus, not one pencil he had broken
When staining albums overall;
Here a dictator of the balls
Stood like a picture at the doors,
Like ruddy cherub at Palm week
He did not move, was mute and pink;
Here was a traveler - by chance
Appeared at home starched brazen guy,
In all the guests evoking smile
By mannered posture he advanced;
The mocking glances with no word
Displayed a verdict he was worth.

XXVII

But my Onegin spent the evening
Watching Tatiana, no one else,
Yet, not the girl stirred by the feeling,
Enamored, simple and artless,
But a princess, aloof, cold-blooded,
Goddess inscrutable for mind,
Who at the Neva’s banks does reign.
Oh, people, you are all the same,
Behave like your foremother Eva...
What you do have - does not attract,
The serpent does seduce and tempt,
Calls to the tree of good and evil...
Forbidden fruit you want to eat,
If not, then, Eden you don’t need.

XXVIII

How unexpected were these changes!
How well Tatiana played the role
Of an unblemished noble lady,
How well complied with the great world!
And could you find in this lady,
Who looked so stately and so fairy,
The features of a tender girl?
And he sometimes disturbed her soul?
Morpheus did not, yet, arrived,
Her languish look by Moon was seized,
She flied to him in virgin’s dreams,
Bewitched by magic dark of night.
She wished her life with him to share,
To take submissively his way!

XXIX

The love can conquer any ages,
But for the virgin youthful hearts
It’s bursts are worth of highest praises,
Remind me the vernal floods...
The fields attain required freshness,
Revive and ripen in rain’s passions;
The life is seeking to produce,
Both, gorgeous blossoms and sweet fruits.
But in the late and fruitless years,
When your life stream is turning back,
The passion’s trace looks dead and sad.
The autumn storm destroys and rends,
By ugly bogs replaces meadows;
Instead of forests we get shadows.

XXX

Alas, no doubt, my Onegin
Like a teenager fell in love;
In melancholy always staying
He can not think of other stuff.
Despite the common sense approach,
He drives to her vitreous porch,
And does it almost every day,
And chases after her like shade;
He feels so happy when he’s slipping
A fluffy boa on her neck,
Or manages her way to track,
While she is graciously proceeding
Through mannered crowd of beau monde,
Or to her gestures can respond.

XXXI

She does not notice all his troubles,
However hard he tries, in vain.
She still receives him at her house,
May at the routs few words say.
Sometimes she greets him by a bow,
Then, does not notice him at all...
There is no coquetry in that -
The high life does not like him, yet.
Onegin is morbidly paling -
She does not see, or does not care,
He’s starting pining - still no way.
It is consumption, people saying.
They send Onegin to hakeem,
And this prescribes the spa to him.

XXXII

He does not go there and is ready
Before right term to follow dad.
Tatiana still is calm and steady
(What can you do, they’re all like that).
But he is stubborn, does not stop
To follow her and cherishes hope;
And bolder than a healthy man
The sick man writes a letter, then,
A passionate and reckless letter.
Though he considered it in vain
To write the letters and complain,
But heart ache is an acid matter,
It made him resolute and bold,
Here is his letter, word-to-word.

Onegin’s letter to Tatiana

I can foresee, you’ll be offended
By my sad mystery explain.
Your eyes will radiate disdain,
Despise to me will be extended!
What do I want? What is the reason
To show to you my naked soul?
And what a vicious derision,
Maybe, will stir my reckless call!

I happened meet you years ago,
A spark of tenderness you showed,
But to believe I did not dare,
And did not follow the sweet habit,
Just of my freedom, so repellent,
At that time I preferred to care.

One more thing separated us:
Poor Lensky tragically perished.
And all what pleased my heart at once
So accidentally was ravished.
Thus, alien to the world and sad,
I thought that liberty and quiet
Can replace happiness, but find
A severe punishment for that!

I’d love to watch you every moment,
To follow you at every turn.
Smile of your lips, of the eyes movement
That’s what I love to see and learn.
To listen to you, comprehend
By loving soul all your perfection,
In front of you in thrill to stand,
To pale and still in great affection!

I am deprived of that, and thus,
Drag after you on chance relying.
I value hours, - alas,
In useless boring they are dying.
The fate has counted all these,
And they are painful besides this.
I know that my age is determined,
But to continue my life way,
I must be sure in the morning
That shall see you again by day…

I am afraid that in my praying
Your severe look will find proof
Of a sly person’s undertaking,
Thus, I foresee irate reproof.
If you could know, what a disaster
To suffer thirst of love in vain,
To burn, then, terminate to foster
The admiration sense by brain,
To wish to nestle at your knees
And at your feet burst out sobbing,
Pour out secrets, prays, appeals,
All what my soul to fit affording.
And at same time for all that craving
To simulate cold speech and gaze,
Pronounce common banal phrase
While cheerful look at you remaining!

But let it be, what can I do,
I can’t withstand it anymore
And play this miserable role,
My fortune I entrust to you.

XXXIII

There’s no reply. He writes next letter,
But to the second, to the third
No answer, yet. Just some days later
He’s at a gathering, and what?
She is approaching looking stern
And does not see him, not at all!
Her eyes now radiate utmost
Siberian severe frost!
His soul is full of indignation!
His lips compressed, he cannot speak,
She looks so calm, she is not sick!
He cannot find explanation...
Where are the traces of the tears?
There’s none, just remains of the fierce...

XXXIV

Besides, perhaps, of secret fear.
The world and husband can suspect
The pranks, unfaithfulness reveal...
All what Onegin knew of that...
There is no hope! Onegin leaves
By his foolhardiness displeased.
And being by regret absorbed
He, as before, disclaims the world.
And in his study’s taciturn
He is remembering that time,
When he remained in self exile,
Avoided public life’s uproar,
And by severe khandra was chased,
It trapped him, in dark corner placed.

XXXV

He started reading in succession
The books by Gibbon and Russo,
Manzoni’s and Chamfort’s reflections,
Madame de Stael, La Biche, Tissot,
The skeptical essays by Belle,
Philosophy by Fontenelle,
Some native books he also read
Rejecting nothing; besides that,
The almanacs and magazines,
Where sermons they reiterate,
Where against me today they prate,
Though, sometimes used to praise and please.
What can I tell about them...
E sempre bene, gentlemen.

XXXVI

And what? His eyes continued reading,
But mind sought for something more;
Dreams, wishes, grieves of human being
Were deeply harassing his soul.
And between all the printed lines
He read by the spiritual eyes
The other lines, and just by these
He used to be completely seized.
These were the mysteries and legends
Of obscure cordial old times,
Beyond his comprehension signs,
The prophecies you can’t imagine,
Fears, rumors, lively fairy tales
Or maiden’s letters worth of praise.

XXXVII

And little by little he got seized
By lulling of the thoughts and sense.
And his Imagination dreams
And shuffles cards like faro plays.
Sometimes a youthful guy he’s seeing,
On melting snow he’s quietly dreaming
Like at a peaceful nighttime stay.
- That’s that. He’s killed. - Someone does say.
Then, he sees slanderers, mean cowards,
For long forgotten evil foes,
The former friends, who despise cause,
A swarm of young unfaithful lovers,
Then, country home, chilled glassy pane,
And she is sitting... She again!

XXXVIII

He was so much upset by all that
That started to behave like mad,
Or even turned to be a poet.
He’d made me by that pretty glad!
It’s quite correct... at that right time
He was quite close the words to rhyme.
My muddle-headed pupil, thus,
The Russian rhymes began to grasp.
Yes, he resembled quite a poet,
When in a corner sat alone.
In fireplace the flame was on,
And he was Benedetta purring
Or Idol mio, and same time
Dropped shoe or book into the fire.

XXXIX

The days ran fast; the winter air
Warmed up, the bitter cold extinguished.
To be a poet he didn’t dare,
Did not get mad, the life didn’t finish.
The spring gives life to him and, thus,
He leaves his dwelling place at last,
Where he spent time like ground hog,
With double windows always locked
By fireside spleen exercising.
The sky is blue, the bright sun shines,
In sleigh by Neva’s bank he drives
And watches how the snow is piling,
The ice turns blue, the people hives.
Where do you think my hero rides?

XL

Can you divine, where’s Eugene speeding?
Yes, you are perfect, he has got
To Tanya’s home, where she is living.
Here is my hero, sad and odd.
He walks in looking like dead pale,
Meets nobody in a hallway,
Enters a parlor, no one, yet,
Proceeds ahead and what is that?
What can stir up such a strong feeling?
Princess that sits in front of him,
Alone, not decorated, dim.
A letter in her hands, she’s reading,
The tears are streaming, looking meek
She’s leaning against hand by cheek.

XLI

Oh, is there somewhere such a being
Who could not see her pain at that!
Who could not recognize the feeling
Of former Tanya, shy and sad!
Embraced by mad regret and grief
Onegin dropped at Tanya’s feet.
She startled slightly, staying mute
At Eugene turned her distant look
With no astonishment or anger...
And she perceived his obscure gaze
And by his view was not amazed.
She looks aware. A simple maiden,
Who dreams and feels like in passed days,
Has resurrected nowadays.

XLII

She does not raise him up, besides,
To look at him she cannot end,
Can not the avid lips deprive
Of right to kiss her senseless hand...
What is she dreaming now about?
They stay for long remaining silent,
And finally she gave a sigh...
“Enough, please, listen for a while.
I want to be sincere and honest.
Do you remember this nice place,
Where Fortune put us face to face,
The garden alley, lake and forest?
You gave a lesson, I did learn.
I think today it is my turn.

XLIII

It seems to me, when being younger,
I should be better than am now;
I loved you not by love to brother,
How did you pay me for my love?
What was response? The stern reflection.
You wouldn’t deny, shy girl’s affection
Didn’t make a novelty to you.
Till now, my God, I feel so poor,
The blood runs cold, when I remember
Your cold reprimand and your gaze.
I do not blame you... dreadful days...
It was so noble to surrender...
You were correct with me and fair
And I am grateful for your care.

XLIV

You shouldn’t deny that in the desert,
Away from vanity and fame,
You did not find me be pleasant.
Why are you chasing me today?
Why do you now single me out?
Is it because at high life’s routs
As a princess I now appear,
Nobility and wealth reveal?
My husband by the war is maimed,
And we are by the court caressed,
And now you search for my disgrace,
To be in the whole world defamed,
And by attempting evil fate
You’d gain the tempting high life rate?

XLV

I’m weeping now... But if you haven’t
Forgotten Tanya of passed day,
Then please do know, I swear by Heaven,
From all these things you should refrain.
And if I have a chance to choose,
Your cold response and sense abuse
I should prefer against the passions,
Your letters and the love expressions.
In the old days you showed compassion,
At least respect to my young years.
And what today, what odd affairs,
What trifle brought you to this session!
How can you with your heart and brain
Be a mean slave of sense and fame?

XLVI

You know, Onegin, all this brilliance
And tinsel of the fashion style,
The high society bright experience,
My fancy house and this shine
Are vanity, and I’ll be glad
Replace this trash and masquerade,
These luster, noise and exclamations
By former simple habitation,
By this so meek and nice surround,
Neglected garden, books, all that
Where you and I first time had met,
And by the sad burial ground,
Where now the cross and branches’ shade
Spread over my poor nanny’s grave...

XLVII

We could be happy, yes, could be.
But my fate is resolved already!
You can complain that, probably,
Sometimes I was not too much wary...
My mother implored shedding tears,
Poor Tanya could not withstand these.
All lots to me looked just the same.
And I got married. Thus, I say,
You should not chase me anymore.
I know that you till now retain
Your perfect features and are fair.
I love you, but what is it for?
To other man I am a wife
And will be faithful all my life”.

XLVIII

She’s left. Onegin stays upset,
Like being stricken by a thunder.
And what a passions’ storm at that
His weary soul has now to endure!
But clinking of the spurs we hear,
Tatiana’s husband enters. Here
We’ll say good bye to my tale’s hero,
Right at this minute so much evil
We leave him there. And how for long?
For long, and probably for ever.
It is enough with him to travel
All over. Now we hear a gong,
We’ve moored, and should exclaim Hurrah!
It’s time to finish it, so far!

XLIX

Whoever are you, my verse reader,
A friend or enemy, I do
Want to part with you as a fellow.
Forgive me please. Whatever you
Did search in these nonchalant verses,
The memoirs, recollection sources,
Or a repose of your hard job,
The lively pictures or catchword,
Mistakes in grammar, spelling errors,
God willing, I’ll be very glad,
If reading this book you could get,
For heart, for fun, for journal quarrels
At least a chip of feel and sense.
I beg for mercy and say thanks!

L

Farewell to you, my odd companion,
And you, my Idol, fair and true,
And you so living and continual
My modest work. I’ve learned with you
All that, what causes poet’s envy...
Oblivion in the high life rally,
The sweet discussions with the friends.
So many, many days have passed
Since that time, when Tatiana’s image
And my Onegin in a dream
Appeared to me and brought to thrill,
And I began to plan and cherish
My future novel’s obscure span,
Through magic crystal it to scan.

LI

But you, to whom at friendly meeting
I declaimed my first novel’s rhymes…
These are away, those beyond reaching,
As Sadi used to say sometimes.
Onegin was besides that pictured.
And she, who by my Muse was featured
As an Ideal and high praised…
So much, so many Fate erased!
Blessed is the one, who has left early
The Being revel and full cup
Of wine has not yet bottomed up,
Who hasn’t read to the end Its story,
But quitted suddenly, that’s why
I say to my Onegin bye.

The End
